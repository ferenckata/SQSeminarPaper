    "abstract": "<jats:p>Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</jats:p>",

Sci-Hub has grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub’s database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at https://greenelab.github.io/scihub allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Software quality in computational tools impacts research output in a variety of scientific disciplines. Biology is one of these fields, especially for High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data, such tools play an important role. This study therefore characterises the overall quality of a selection of tools which are frequently part of HTS pipelines, as well as analyses the maintainability and process quality of a selection of HTS alignment tools. Our findings highlight the most pressing issues, and point to software engineering best practices developed for the improvement of maintenance and process quality. To help future research, we share the tooling for the static code analysis with SonarCloud which we used to collect data on the maintainability of different alignment tools. The results of the analysis show that the maintainability level is generally high but trends towards increasing technical debt over time. We also observed that the development activities on alignment tools are generally driven by very few developers and are not utilising modern tooling to their advantage. Based on these observations, we recommend actions to improve both maintainability and process quality in open source alignment tools. Those actions include improvements in tooling like the use of linters as well as better documentation of architecture and features. We encourage developers to use these tools in order to ease future maintenance efforts, increase user experience, support reproducibility, and ultimately increase the quality of research through increasing the quality of research software tools.",
