## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Since high-throughput techniques became a staple in science laboratories, computational algorithms and scientific software boomed.
However, scientific software, specifically bioinformatics software, usually lacks software development quality standards.
It results in software code that is hard to test (or independently verify), reuse, and maintain.
We believe the root of inefficiency in implementing the best software development practices in academic settings is the individualistic approach, which has traditionally been the norm for recognizing scientific achievements and, by extension, for developing specialized software.
Software development is a collective effort in most software-heavy endeavors.
Indeed, the literature suggests teamwork directly impacts code quality through knowledge sharing, collective software development, and established coding standards.
In our computational biology research groups, we explored ways to sustainably involve all group members in learning, sharing, and discussing software development while maintaining the personal ownership of research projects and related software products.
We found that through weekly meetings, within a year, regular members improved their coding skills, became more efficient bioinformaticians, and obtained detailed knowledge about the work of their peers, triggering new collaborative projects.
Each member learned about advanced concepts through within-group knowledge transfer without investing significant time.
We can now quickly identify and access each other's expertise and have established standards to which new members must comply.
We strongly advocate for improving software development culture within bioinformatics through local collective effort in computational biology groups or institutes with three or more bioinformaticians.
This manuscript provides the necessary overview of the best coding practice literature.
It describes how we improved our software development culture through three pillars: (1) software quality seminars, (2) code reviews, and (3) resource sharing.
We hope that our shared experience and suggestions will boost the implementation of similar initiatives for improved academic training and a more sustainable environment for academic software practice.
