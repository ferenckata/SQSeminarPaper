## Abstract {.page_break_before}

It has been noted multiple times in the past decades that scientific, and more specifically bioinformatics software is developed with less than ideal care and knowledge [@doi:10.1109/mic.2014.88; @doi:10.1109/ms.2007.155; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2; @doi:10.1126/science.314.5807.1856].
The consequence of this is code hard to test (or independently verify), reuse, and maintain.
Several groups have suggested solutions to this problem [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbw134; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.2996; @doi:10.1016/j.jmoldx.2017.11.003; @doi:10.12688/f1000research.29032.1], however the issue persists.
We believe the root of inefficiency in implementing best software development practices in the academic settings is the individualistic approach.
Software development is a collective effort in most software-heavy endevours.
The literature suggests that team work directly impacts code quality through knowledge sharing, redundancy, and standards [@https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/].
In our computational biology research groups, we explored ways to sustainably involve all group members in learning, sharing, and discussing software, while maintaining the personal ownership of research projects and related software products.
We found that through weekly meetings, within a year, regular members improved their coding skills, became more efficient bioinformaticians, and obtained a detailed knowledge about the work of their peers.
Through within-group knwoledge transfer, without investing significant amount of time, each member obtained knowledge about advanced concepts, can now quickly identify and access the expertise of each other, and established standards to which new members are also required to comply.
We advocate for improvement of software development culture within bioinformatics through local collective effort, while hoping that top-down approaches such as publication requirements for code become standard in the near future.
