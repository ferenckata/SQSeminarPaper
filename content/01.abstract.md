## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Ever since the high-throughput techniques became a staple in science laboratories, the generation of computational algorithms and scientific software boomed.
However, more recently it has been noted that scientific software, more specifically bioinformatics software, lacks the quality standards of software development.
The consequence of this is code hard to test (or independently verify), reuse, and maintain.
We believe the root of inefficiency in implementing the best software development practices in the academic settings is the individualistic approach.
Software development is a collective effort in most software-heavy endeavours.
The literature suggests that team work directly impacts code quality through knowledge sharing, redundancy, and standards.
In our computational biology research groups, we explored ways to sustainably involve all group members in learning, sharing, and discussing software, while maintaining the personal ownership of research projects and related software products.
We found that through weekly meetings, within a year, regular members improved their coding skills, became more efficient bioinformaticians, and obtained a detailed knowledge about the work of their peers.
Through within-group knowledge transfer, without investing significant amount of time, each member obtained knowledge about advanced concepts, can now quickly identify and access the expertise of each other, and established standards to which new members are also required to comply.
We advocate for improvement of software development culture within bioinformatics through local collective effort, while hoping that top-down approaches such as publication requirements for code become standard in the near future.
