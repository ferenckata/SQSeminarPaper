## Discussion ##

We implemented a form of code review that fits our specific needs and context.
We used our experience from these sessions, with special focus on team-based software development practices ensuring good code quality during in the update of the curation analysis software of the 2024 release of the JASPAR database (<span style="background-color: yellow">citation</span>).
In this project, as well as in some of our own individual research projects, we introduced user stories when documenting the assumptions, current features and new ideas, and we relied on development tools such as Jira and git.
We note that the usage of these tools is not necessarily aligned with industry practices, due to the experimental nature of scientific software.
Nevertheless, as bioinformatics becomes a more and more software-heavy field, we believe a good direction is to collectively lower the barrier to adapting to new technologies.

How to decide when it is time to invest in a script?
[@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412] suggests a cut-off where a script is being reused, shared with others or used to produce findings in a publication.

There is a method called ad-hoc testing, which could be beneficial for scientists without test plans or documentation.
It is flexible, allows creativity and discovery of new requirements [@{https://www.browserstack.com/guide/adhoc-testing}].
However, it is not advised to be used on its own, as it is not robust and requires extensive know-how.
