We reviewed the existing literature that focuses on providing guidelines of programming practices for scientists without extensive training in computational sciences. We used several key phrases to search for papers: “guidelines for bioinformatics software”, “rules for biologists learning bioinformatics”. Such papers are quite abundant and have several things in common. For example, they can focus on very specific suggestions, often referred to as rules or “tips & tricks”, or they can more broadly direct towards good practices of coding, which are put together into “guidelines”.

Specific or broad guidelines
Papers often choose a main focus or a theme and then distinguish a set of rules or guidelines. That focus can either be very specific, such as particular data analysis in a single disease. Or the theme can be more general, often setting the rules for next-generation sequencing data (NGS) analysis or outlining tips on how to start on computational analysis of the experimental data [REF]. Both types of papers emphasize the need to learn how to analyze data properly and provide good suggestions to do that, based on the chosen topic. However, one needs to be aware when reading specialized focus guidelines that some of them can be much less applicable if the context of the analysis is different. Finally, the reference point matters. There is a difference, if the guidelines are read by a person with less experience in computational data analysis, where even a small set of rules can mean a steep learning curve, because some skills that are dependencies for the rules might be common knowledge for those with more experience. For example, a guideline to use version control systems, such as git, is a very important one, but for that a reader should most likely know the basics of the unix command line, which is not necessarily a rule on itself. One of the first things such guidelines should do and many of them do, is to define the target audience even if they are meant to be broader suggestions.

Most common suggestions
As already mentioned, suggestions often overlap. Most commonly highlighted are documentation and version control [REFS]. These are basic aspects of the software quality, which are still often overlooked in the publications making it hard to reproduce the research or use a published software. Even the people with least experience in computational analyses should always document their code by writing extensive README. Documentation practice is very strong in the wet lab, where having a lab journal is essential. This should not be different when working with computational tools. Version control of the code improved research reproducibility and usage of the software. The most popular way to do that is by using git and remote repositories, for example, GitHub or Bitbucket [REFS]. 
Less commonly emphasized are testing of the developed code or software and optimization of pipelines [REFS].

Nowadays, there are multiple available tools to help organize the coding tasks and the code itself. For example, using task management through Jira or GitHub issues. However, this is not practiced very often with biomedicine-related software. It might partly be, because of the lack of experience and awareness of the need for such practices. These tools are essential for team projects. However, most of the guidelines for software quality improvement focus on the individual persons and their personal practices, which  with projects Most of the guidelines 






Lack of focus on the team aspect
Having identified the common suggestions mentioned in the papers, it is very important to see what is commonly lacking in the majority of them. Guidelines are usually targeted to individual persons.
