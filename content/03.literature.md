## Overview of suggested coding practices #

Bioinformaticians often use error-prone development practices to create software or pipelines.
This practice leads to poor quality and solutions that fall short of ideal due to the insufficient application of proper software engineering methods [@doi:10.1109/MS.2007.155].
In the past two decades, software engineering researchers have surveyed and discussed the limitations and caveats of scientific software development practices and products (e.g., see [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88]).
Moreover, online learning and support resources are vital for bioinformaticians who are self-taught programmers.
These include peer blog posts, open-source lecture materials from universities, forums, and published guidelines for improved coding and data analysis.
The encouraged practices are plenty.
However, the current coding practices relevant to bioinformatics software development vary and depend on factors such as prior training in computer science and specific scientific research fields.
Finally, the suggested practices do not necessarily include a consistent view in line with mainstream software standards.

Thus, we selected articles as entry points for bioinformaticians who aim to improve their programming skills.
We provide an overview of the suggestions presented in these papers in **Table 1** (**Supplementary Methods**).
While this type of article usually targets early career researchers with minimal coding experience (e.g., first-time terminal users), they often encourage using state-of-the-art software solutions (e.g., containers), which seem contradictory.
Therefore, these guidelines represent a mix of primary and advanced concepts usually provided as lists of rules or "tips & tricks."
The large spectrum of guidelines to follow highlights the unique challenges emerging in bioinformatics, even for routine pipelines and software development for data analysis.

**Table 1** might initially intimidate due to the extensive list of recommendations.
This complexity reflects how the bioinformatics community struggles to implement these guidelines [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Recognizing that the widespread adoption of these standards will prove complicated through individual efforts, we considered a more collaborative strategy.
Indeed, we aimed to revise our techniques and methods to ensure the successful integration of these guidelines into our practices.
More specifically, our experience indicated a greater likelihood of adopting these critical practices and working collectively towards better software engineering proficiency.

Updating software development practices or gaining a good understanding of new concepts is not trivial.
For instance, Arvanitou _et al._ noted that a scientific software developer must choose between various good practices depending on developing a software tool or a data analysis pipeline [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848].
The authors argue that the selection of practices should follow the software quality attributes to prioritize [@{https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010?limit=3%20}].
Importantly, it implies that priorities will vary between software products based on the trade-offs between these attributes (e.g., performance vs security).
As bioinformaticians are rarely familiar with the meaning and importance of these attributes [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44, @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954; @doi:10.1109/MS.2008.85], we present an overview and short descriptions in **Supplementary Table 1**.
Within bioinformatics, attributes such as functional suitability and performance are implicitly prioritized, while other attributes, such as maintainability, portability, and reliability, are often neglected.
Through implicit prioritization, most software is developed as a prototype, even when the goal is to create a long-term product [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01901-x].
This report focuses on three target quality attributes as our learning goals: reliability, performance, and extensibility (see also **Figure 1**).

The hardship of systematic, automated testing of scientific software has been discussed in detail [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954; @doi:10.1109/MS.2008.85; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
Uncovered faults can, and sometimes do, lead to incorrect scientific insights, as shown in multiple examples [@doi:10.1126/science.314.5807.1856].
This observation prompted us to investigate this issue further.
<!-- KF: incorporate the fruits of slack disco -->
<!-- From slack: Unexpected discoveries can confound expected outcomes and error detection, so scientific software development requires adaptive testing methods to maintain scientific integrity. -->
<!-- Often, in science we use software to generate new knowledge, and we often do not know *a priori* what the exact output of a software should be. > <!-- AM: I remove this sentence entirely as I feel it conveys a wrong message that goes against unit testing. If we do not know what the output of a software should be, we cannot know what to test. MK: I removed " for a new input dataset" because I do not think it is needed. If you want to include it back in, I'd recommend rephrasing this -->
Furthermore, scientists view their scientific model and its implementation as a single entity [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954].
Therefore, one tends to assess the model's validity but not thoroughly the code that implements it.
These observations highlight the importance of considering unit testing and verification for scientific software (**Figure 1**, **Supplementary Table 2**).

A fundamental aspect of bioinformatics software development involves the integration of functionalities from various software packages -- a concept referring to collections of code that perform specific tasks.
This approach of combining packages from several resources has several implications [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88; @doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804].
Among these, we focus on two critical issues.
First, over time, the software may become increasingly challenging to maintain.
Indeed, the complexity, size, age, and code's change-proneness heavily affect its maintainability [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44].
One can address this increased complexity through a shared understanding and implementation of functions and modularization (**Figure 1**, **Supplementary Table 2**).
Second, package management (including versioning) is crucial to ensure maintenance and ease of development, reproducibility, and reusability.
Frameworks [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.29032.1; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3820] and package management solutions [@{https://www.anaconda.com/}; @{https://docs.docker.com/}; @{https://apptainer.org/}] are required to achieve these qualities (**Figure 1**, **Supplementary Table 2**).

We found that the literature mainly targeted towards bioinformaticians rarely covers the topic of coding as a team or using multiple people's expertise in software development.
Usually, the advice encourages beginners to ask for help when facing problems with their code, not to work together from the start.
Such advice includes consulting with colleagues, finding a mentor, or participating in online communities (e.g., Stack Overflow or Biostars) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
However, the described framework primarily focuses on individual practices, calls upon a specific (often scientific) issue, and insufficiently recognizes unknown unknowns.
This scheme contradicts software engineering-oriented literature, where the main focus is on practices for coding in teams [@https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development; @doi:10.1007/s10664-012-9205-0].
The only counterexample we found is the Code Clubs described by Hagan et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119].
In their research group, members collectively engage in software development through code reviews, coding in pairs, and software engineering education through workshops or seminars [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119].
The authors of Code Clubs present tips on organizing meetings to receive the best support and learn new software quality-related concepts.
<!-- AM: It looks pretty similar to what you describe in this paper. What is the added value of yours? >
<!-- VK: code club paper identifies multiple opinions as added values, whereas we understand the collective work as added value. -->
<!-- IR: I think they do understand that collective work is an added value, but their paper mostly gives tips on how to manage those meetings. They do not really analyze why it is important. -->
Sharing coding experiences with others helps minimize isolation, allows individuals to learn from their peers, and maintains standards for writing better-quality software.
Therefore, we established a learning club called software quality seminars, regular code reviews, and a resource-sharing platform to foster team effort (**Figure 1**).
In the following sections, we will share our experience and recommendations, beginning with the merit of a team-based approach to software development.

***Table 1:*** **Collection of recommendations for improving scientific software quality.** Some guidelines are vague, have a varied scope, and target different stakeholders. Therefore, finding individual responsibility and actionable points from the literature may be challenging.
