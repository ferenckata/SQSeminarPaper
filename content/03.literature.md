## Guidelines and practices of bioinformatics as seen by software engineers and bioinformaticians ##

The internet is full of learning and support material for developing or working with software products.
Since bioinformaticians are often self-thought programmers and only a small fraction have formal training in computer science and software engineering, these recourses become vital.
They include blog posts from peers, freely available lecture materials from universities, forums or articles that propose guidelines how to code or analyse data in a better way.
The encouraged practices are plenty and vary a lot, therefore the code produced by bioinformaticians lack a certain standard.
The scientific software status has been analysed by the software engineer community, where certain limitations and caveats were identified and discussed.
We provide an overview of the available literature on these discussion points.

First, let us summarize the main themes in papers with guidelines for bioinformaticians.
These articles would be the entry point for bioinformatician who aim to improve their programming skills.
We used several the phrases to search for papers: “guidelines for bioinformatics software”, and “rules for biologists learning bioinformatics”.
Selected papers focus on specific suggestions, often referred to as rules or “tips & tricks”, or they more broadly direct the readers towards good practices of coding, which are put together into guidelines.
Specialized topics include particular data analysis in a single disease [@doi:10.1186/s13024-022-00517-z], while broad themes span from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis to outlining tips on how to start on computational analysis of the experimental data [@doi:10.1016/j.jtho.2022.11.006;@doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.2996;@doi:10.1016/j.jmoldx.2017.11.003].
Both types of papers emphasize the need to learn how to analyse data properly and provide good suggestions to do that, based on the chosen topic.
The guideline papers tend to target early career researchers with minimal coding experience (e.g. first time terminal users), while also encourage the usage of state-of-the-art software solutions (e.g. containers).
Therefore, the guidelines might be a mix of basic and advanced concepts, especially from the perspective of a standard computer science and software engineering curriculum.
For example, documentation and version control are most commonly highlighted [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbw134;@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
However, instructions and tips on how to make your documentation and code up to software quality standards are usually limited, possibly due to the short nature of these guidelines and the lack of sufficient background of the assumed readers.

Next, we performed a second round of literature review to obtain an external view on the status of scientific and whenever possible, bioinformatics software.
The literature search was performed in multiple iterations using Google (to include grey literature) and Google Scholar based on phrases "scientific software development", "software engineering bioinformatics" and "bioinformatics software recommendations" throughout 2023.
Additionally, relevant articles were selected based on the snowball effect from the references of the initial publications.

It is apparent from the literature that software engineers have noticed the separation between software engineering and scientific computing community.
Already almost two decades ago, Diane F. Kelly wrote that scientific computations keep on being performed using error-prone development practices and reaching suboptimal solutions and poor software quality due to lack of appropriate software engineering practices [@doi:10.1109/MS.2007.155].
Therefore, the software engineering community also writes guidelines on how these practices should be followed after surveying the current state of software in scientific community and specifically the bioinformatics community [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In addition, an extensive literature review has been published recently in which known issues and suggested solutions are collected [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
We collected these recommendations into Table @tbl:sq-recommendations.

Table: Collection of recommendations for improving scientific software quality. Some guidelines are more vague than others, they also have varied scope, and they target different stakeholders. Therefore, it may be hard to find individual responsibility and actionable points from the literature.
{#tbl:sq-recommendations}

The first impression Table @tbl:sq-recommendations might give is being intimidated by the sheer amount of recommendations.
It is unrealistic to expect that a bioinformatician on temporary contract, working towards publishing, without formal training in computer science, or institutional support would be able to gain a good understanding and practice in all of them.
Beyond understanding, Arvanitou et al. note that a scientific software developer needs to prioritize the software quality attributes to make choices among the good practices [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848].
They provide a matrix to help with the selection and priorization.
Depending on the application of the scientific software, whether it is a tool or a data analysis pipeline, the authors may prioritize different quality attributes [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848].
For example, in the world of big data, performance and efficiency gain importance.
An issue might be, as mentioned above, is that bioinformaticians are rarely familiar with the meaning and importance of software quality attributes.

Therefore, it is not surprising, that the guidelines from software engineers are struggling to penetrate the bioinformatics community [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Among the recommended practices are agile software development, the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle, requirements gathering and unit testing.
We noted that these concept are not intuitive, well known in the bioinformatics community, or even trivial to adapt to the bioinformatics software development environment [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44, @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954; @doi:10.1109/MS.2008.85].
However, it is self-evident that the challenges in adopting good software development practices cannot be an excuse for skipping them.
In the coming paragraphs we highlight some insights about the recommended concepts and practices from the literature review.

One insight was that some advanced concepts, like object-oriented programming (OOP) and extreme programming are known and used in the bioinformatics community, but they are not used to their full power [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44].
To illustrate this, in case of OOP, bioinformaticians might use classes and inheritance, but rarely encapsulation and polymorphism [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44].

The hardship of scientific software testing has been also discussed in details [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954; @doi:10.1109/MS.2008.85; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
Globe emphasized the importance of software testing with an analogy, comparing it to the importance of testing the functionality of a microscope, which is self-evident to all researchers [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In a recent review paper [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954] two key aspects of scientific software testing has been highlighted: the oracle problem and the cultural differences between scientists and software engineers.
First, software behaviour can be tested against an expected output, but often in science we use software to find new knowledge.
This results in an oracle problem, when scientists actually do not know *a priori* how the software should behave, thus straight forward verification is impossible.
Second, according to the authors, scientists also view their scientific model and the implementation as a single entity.
Therefore, scientists tend to test the validity of the model but not verify the code which produces it.
Uncovered faults can and do lead to incorrect scientific insights as shown in multiple examples [@doi:10.1126/science.314.5807.1856].

The third insight is about the complexity of bioinformatics software.
In bioinformatics analysis it is common to combine the functionalities that are coming from various packages.
This poses three different problems [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.8].
First, the package management (including versioning) is a crutial aspect to ensure ease of development, reproducibility, reusability, and maintenance.
In contrasts to mainstream software development, bioinformatics software developers view their code as "means to an end" and care less about the future of the software they are writing.
Bioinformaticians are not well aware of the relationship between complexity, size, age, and the change-proneness of a code, which heavily affect maintainability [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44].
Frameworks, such as Snakemake [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.29032.1] or Nextflow [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3820] support usability, reliability, and maintainability.
Anaconda [@{https://www.anaconda.com/}] and container solutions [@{https://docs.docker.com/}; @{https://apptainer.org/}] help achieve portability.
These are also compatible with Snakemake and Nextflow, making these frameworks staple for reproducible data analysis.
Second, it is practically impossible to test all functionalities of all modules, and the combinations of various functionalities.
It is therefore instrumental that the developers of the modules are trustworthy and responsible in their development.
It has been shown in a previous study reviewing mappers, that individual tools have varying level of compatibility, usability, and portability [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804]; quality attributes which directly impact user experience.

A recurring question is whether a script needs refactoring or can remain a prototype.
Taschuk and Wilson [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412] suggest a cut-off where a script is being reused, shared with others or used to produce findings in a publication.
This definition would potentially include the majority of code written by bioinformaticians, but the time spent on improving the scripts should be weighed against the time required to deal with suboptimal code.
Overall, as good practices become routine, the required time investment will be reduced and the benefits will become more apparent.

Finally, to our knowledge bioinformatics literature almost never presents suggestions on how to code in a team setting and utilize multiple people's expertise on software development.
Often guidelines for starting bioinformaticians encourage reaching out to others, but mostly to seek help when encountering a problem with their code.
This could include consulting with colleagues, finding a mentor or participating in online communities (for example, Stack Overflow or Biostars) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
However, it is still mainly focused on individual practices, does not involve peer-pressure, and insufficient to recognize unknown unknowns.
One counter example is the Code Clubs described by Hagan et al..
In their research group members are collectively engaged in software development through code reviews and pair coding and software engineering education through workshops or seminars [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119].
It is in contrary to software engineering-oriented literature, where the main focus is on practices when coding in a team [@https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development; @doi:10.1007/s10664-012-9205-0].
Sharing your coding experience with others helps minimize the isolation, allows individuals to learn from their peers, helps to establish and maintain standards, and helps to write a better quality software.
