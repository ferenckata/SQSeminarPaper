## Overview of currently suggested coding practises for bioinformaticians ##

The internet is full of learning and support material for developing or working with software products.
Since bioinformaticians are often self-taught programmers and only a small fraction have formal training in computer science and software engineering, these recourses become vital.
They include blog posts from peers, freely available lecture materials from universities, forums or articles that propose guidelines on how to code or analyse data in a better way.
The encouraged practices are plenty and vary a lot, therefore the code produced by bioinformaticians lack a certain standard.
The scientific software status has been analysed by the software engineer community, where certain limitations and caveats were identified and discussed.
We provide an overview of the available literature on these discussion points.

First, let us summarize the main themes in papers with guidelines for bioinformaticians.
These articles would be the entry point for bioinformatician who aim to improve their programming skills.
We used several phrases to search for papers: “guidelines for bioinformatics software”, and “rules for biologists learning bioinformatics”.
Selected papers focus on specific suggestions, often referred to as rules or “tips & tricks”, or they more broadly direct the readers towards good practices of coding, which are put together into guidelines.
Specialized topics include particular data analysis in a single disease [@doi:10.1186/s13024-022-00517-z], while broad themes span from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis to outlining tips on how to start on computational analysis of the experimental data [@doi:10.1016/j.jtho.2022.11.006;@doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.2996;@doi:10.1016/j.jmoldx.2017.11.003].
Both types of papers emphasize the need to learn how to analyse data properly and provide good suggestions to do that, based on the chosen topic.
The guideline papers tend to target early career researchers with minimal coding experience (e.g. first time terminal users), while also encourage the usage of state-of-the-art software solutions (e.g. containers).
This mix of basic and advanced concepts, especially from the perspective of a standard computer science and software engineering curriculum, highlight the unique challenges emerging in bioinformatics even for routine analyses.
Furthermore, the characteristically varied backgrounds among bioinformaticians adds to the challenge of establishing broadly adopted and effective guidelines or standards.
This results in limited tips or recommendations covering recurring themes such as documentation and version control [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbw134;@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].

Next, we performed a second round of literature review to obtain an external view on the status of scientific and whenever possible, bioinformatics software.
The literature search was performed in multiple iterations using Google (to include grey literature) and Google Scholar based on phrases "scientific software development", "software engineering bioinformatics" and "bioinformatics software recommendations" throughout 2023.
Additionally, relevant articles were selected based on the snowball effect from the references of the initial publications.

It is apparent from the literature that scientific software is not up to software engineering standards.
Already almost two decades ago, Diane F. Kelly wrote that scientific computations keep on being performed using error-prone development practices and reaching suboptimal solutions and poor software quality due to lack of appropriate software engineering practices [@doi:10.1109/MS.2007.155].
Therefore, the software engineering community also writes guidelines on how these practices should be followed after surveying the current state of software in scientific community and specifically the bioinformatics community [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In addition, an extensive literature review has been published recently in which known issues and suggested solutions are collected [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
We collected these recommendations into Table @tbl:sq-recommendations.

Table 1: Collection of recommendations for improving scientific software quality.
Some guidelines are more vague than others, they also have varied scope, and they target different stakeholders.
Therefore, it may be hard to find individual responsibility and actionable points from the literature.{#tbl:sq-recommendations}

The first impression Table @tbl:sq-recommendations might give is being intimidated by the sheer amount of recommendations.
It is unrealistic to expect that a bioinformatician on temporary contract, working towards publishing, without formal training in computer science, or institutional support would be able to gain a good understanding and practice in all of them.
Beyond understanding, Arvanitou et al. note that a scientific software developer, depending on the application of the software (e.g. whether it is a tool or a data analysis pipeline), needs to prioritize the software quality attributes to make choices among the good practices [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848].
An issue might be that bioinformaticians are rarely familiar with the meaning and importance of software quality attributes or that their incorporation into their current software development environment isn't trivial [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44, @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954; @doi:10.1109/MS.2008.85].
Therefore, it is not surprising, that the guidelines from software engineers are struggling to penetrate the bioinformatics community [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
This muddled transmission promtps us to re-think our strategies and methods to realise the effective adoption of these software engineering notions.
More specifically, our own experience indicated a greater likelihood of adoption for these notions when engaged as part of a collective effort towards better software engineering proficiency.

Interestingly, throughout our literature review we found only one instance of suggestions on how to code in a team setting and utilize multiple people's expertise on software development.
Often guidelines for starting bioinformaticians encourage reaching out to others, but mostly to seek help when encountering a problem with their code.
This could include consulting with colleagues, finding a mentor or participating in online communities (for example, Stack Overflow or Biostars) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
However, it is still mainly focused on individual practices, does not involve peer-pressure, and insufficient to recognize unknown unknowns.
The one counter example is the Code Clubs described by Hagan et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119].
In their research group, members are collectively engaged in software development through code reviews and pair coding and software engineering education through workshops or seminars [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119].
It is in contrary to software engineering-oriented literature, where the main focus is on practices when coding in a team [@https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development; @doi:10.1007/s10664-012-9205-0].
Sharing your coding experience with others helps minimize the isolation, allows individuals to learn from their peers, helps to establish and maintain standards, and helps to write a better quality software.

In a later section (our experience) we will illustrate with concrete examples how notions like design patterns, standardised documentation or data structures got incorporated in our daily software development practice and thinking through regular instances of collective learning. But first let us turn to the dedicated literature for team-based software development to demonstrate the merit of a collective approach to software development.
