## Status of bioinformatics software from the SE perspective

A landmark paper in 2007 by Diane F. Kelly [@DOI:10.1109/MS.2007.155] discussed the separation ("chasm") between software engineering and scientific-computing community. She points out the need to bridge the one-size-fits all software engineering solutions and the particularities of the scientific software development which relies heavily on domain knowledge. Without such bridge, scientific computations keep on being performed using error-prone development practices and reaching suboptimal solutions and poor software quality. Her predictions seem to hold true even after almost 20 years.

In the past two decades, software enginnering researchers have been surveying bioinformatics software, and more broadly scientific software from the software engineering perspective[@DOI:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; <span style="background-color: yellow">more citations</span>]. The are multiple guidelines and suggestions to improve the quality of scientific code, many of which would target students of scientific disciplines [@DOI:10.1109/MIC.2014.88]. Recently, an extensive literature review has been published which collects known issues and suggested solutions [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839]. Yet, these guidelines seem to not have reached the majority of the bioinformatics community, which is found to be "still in its infancy compared with the majority of other scientific disciplines" [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].

Undoubtedly, scientific software development has its own challenges. However, it cannot be an excuse for skipping good practices: as Carole Globe [@DOI:10.1109/MIC.2014.88] puts it "in Hannay's survey [@DOI:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155], only 47 percent of scientists had a good understanding of testing, and just 34 percent thought any formal training was important. This is strange because presumably they wouldn't use and trust the results of a microscope or telescope that hadn't been built by qualified engineers or tested. Yet software is the most prevalent of all the instruments used in modern science". Software engineering emerged and has been developing to address issues naturally arising from poorly planned development, such as project failures, delays, incorrect functionality or defects [@doi:10.1145/3084225], none of which is unknown to the bioinformatics community.
