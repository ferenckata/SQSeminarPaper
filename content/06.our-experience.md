## Our experience in improving development processes as a team ##

Our team (composed of members from several academic research groups) adopted improved software development practices by implementing three pillars: 1 - software quality seminars, 2 - code review sessions, and 3 - resource sharing.
We describe our experience and recommendations for implementing these pillars.

### Software quality seminars ###

Within the context of our software quality seminars, we implemented a system for transferring knowledge among participants.
Such seminars substitute for a more formal computer science education, which most bioinformaticians lack [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Each seminar is structured to build a shared vocabulary among members to facilitate discussions on implementation details and code structures. 
These seminars include presentations and demonstrations covering basic concepts.
Beyond this, we use this platform to introduce new techniques and showcase tools not limited to specific projects.
It helped in three ways: broadening our collective knowledge, serving as an opportunity to look at theoretical concepts in practice, and building a community by encouraging all members to present their topics of interest.
While preparing the lectures can represent a significant time investment, this effort is rewarded by the substantial knowledge gained from attending each other's presentations.
Finally, the investment pays off in the long run since acquiring knowledge leads to greater efficiency and expertise in future projects.

### Code reviews ###

The benefits of code reviews have been reviewed [@doi:10.5334/jors.35; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119; @{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}, @ISBN:9780201616224].
Some benefits, such as implementing consistent coding standards and detecting bugs/errors, are obvious.
In contrast, others represent less expected outcomes, such as diverse learning, fostering a positive environment, or enhancing efficiency.
Before a scheduled code review, the developer writes their code in a way that others will understand, which enforces improved code readability and structuring.
This expectation is largely self-inflicted - even within a friendly environment.
During a code review session, the developer must clearly explain some aspects of their code (e.g., structure, algorithm implementation, or performance-related decisions).
We recommend that the developer decide the aspect of the code they want to focus on during these sessions.
While code review sessions generally focus on implementation details, they can trigger discussion on any aspect of the code, including architectural considerations, documentation, and user interface design.

The other participants may not be deeply familiar with the project addressed explicitly by the code, but they bring their complementary knowledge and viewpoint.
The feedback obtained can help fix existing or avoid potential future issues, improve the implementation, and produce cleaner and more concise code.
Our experience indicates a broader adoption of theoretical aspects and good software engineering practices.
We highlighted these during code review sessions.
We found that the implicit soft peer pressure derived from these code review sessions successfully addressed most goals: standardization of practices, improved code quality, and enhanced software usability.

As a beneficial side effect, we observed an enhanced understanding of each other's projects that naturally resulted from scrutinizing the code.
It gave a deeper understanding of the underlying scientific questions and led to more insightful comments during subsequent group meetings.
Additionally, a hands-on analysis of everyone's code revealed the repetitiveness of certain coding elements across the projects.
To address this redundancy, we recommend implementing a system to share resources.

### Resource sharing ###

Resource sharing fundamentally involves ensuring that valuable resources are readily accessible to all participants.
We efficiently implemented the sharing of two types of resources: external open-access resources (forums, repositories, packages, and libraries) and internal resources (including tools developed within the groups).
The internal aspect is crucial as it fosters team contributions that enhance individual project development.
For instance, consider a shared repository containing various computational tools developed by multiple group members.
These tools are universal and aligned with the groupâ€™s research questions.
For example, a module that performs a gene set enrichment analysis and summarizes the results can be incorporated into different pipelines without rewriting the code that applies particular packages.
A set of modules with standardized documentation and API becomes a toolkit available for reuse by all group members.
Furthermore, the group collectively develops and reviews the underlying codebase, enhancing utility and quality.

We believe these three pillars are the minimum requirement for achieving lasting improvement in software development within research teams.
Still, bioinformaticians of other groups should tailor the content and the frequency of these meetings to their specific needs.
As a concrete example, regular attendees of our meetings collaboratively worked on the same codebase for the latest JASPAR database release [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkad1059]. They implemented the software development methods discussed in the meetings. These methods included object-oriented programming, user stories for documenting requirements and assumptions, using Jira for feature additions and bug reporting, and continuous integration with Git.
Additionally, it is worth noting that this article was successfully written using Manubot, a tool based on continuous integration [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

In the following sections, we discuss how software quality seminars and code reviews helped with the examples of three specific software engineering notions: modularization, testing, and dependency management.

### Examples of improved development processes ###

From our experience, we observed that it might be challenging to adopt the listed practices.
Therefore, instead of providing rules, we aim to encourage a mindset of mastering software engineering through an iterative process.
We illustrate it by discussing our example concepts from different angles, levels, and formats in the software seminars and in practice at code reviews.
We share specific examples from our projects to highlight how these concepts changed how we produce software (**Supplementary Figures**).

#### Modularization ####

Modular design is one of the most common approaches for team programming, ensuring the maintainability and extensibility of a software product.
We understood from the guidelines and experiences of the team that moving from unstructured scripts to organized code with functions brings several benefits at a low cost.
Consequently, this topic was covered several times during our software quality seminars and code review sessions.

Specifically, we dedicated software quality seminars to the following topics to improve modularization (**Supplementary Table 2**): object-oriented programming, class diagrams and unified modeling language in general, design patterns, software architecture, Snakemake [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.29032.1], S4 objects, R package development, a case report from the organization of the JASPAR database project [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkad1059], and a review of the book titled The Pragmatic Programmer [@ISBN:9780135957059].
We understood that modularization can take form on many levels. On a small scale, it means naming and organizing parts of the code into functions.
Once a code grows, one can start refactoring into classes and focus on the coherence and coupling of the parts (**Supplementary Figure 1-2**).
When building a pipeline of scripts, one can identify coherent modules that would translate to rules in Snakemake [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.29032.1] (**Supplementary Figure 3-4**.)
Modularization means continuously monitoring the code, recognizing a code that grew too much, and re-structuring it into smaller parts.
It involves an understanding that the code is not a static entity but an ever-growing, ever-changing organism.

A recurring question is whether a script needs refactoring or can remain a prototype.
Taschuk and Wilson [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412] suggest a cut-off at which one reuses a script, shares it with others, or uses it to produce findings in a publication.
This definition would potentially include most code written by bioinformaticians.
Still, we should weigh the time spent on improving the scripts against the time required to deal with suboptimal code on a case-by-case basis.
With practice and exposure to a lot of code, modularization becomes the norm, which reduces the distance between a prototype and a refactored code.

#### Testing ####

As highlighted in the literature [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1804.01954], testing is complex for scientific software.
However, it is a central concept in team programming, as test coverage increases trust and allows the safe addition of new features by any member.
We revisited testing multiple times in our session through discussion around debugging tools, how to write unit tests in Python (```pytest``` and ```unittest```) and R (```testthat```), the type of functions to test, and the automation of tests via continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) (**Supplementary Table 2**).
The main challenge usually lies in viewing software testing as more than just validating the scientific features of the software on a small test dataset.
Similarly to modularization, a recurring question was when to start adding tests.
We view testing not as a form of quality control that acts as a sort of checkpoint but as part of an iterative development process.
Therefore, we advise testing early, departing from the mindset: "I will start tomorrow after implementing this new idea."
Peer reviews challenge the implementation, while code reviews provide an optimal platform to discuss tests.
One can view this aspect as a scientific endeavor when we envision the edge cases and discuss the scientific problem the software aims to address.

#### Dependency management ####

Given the large number of dependencies and the entire ecosystem of tools involved in scientific software development, managing these dependencies is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of findings.
In a team setting, it is natural to create identical environments for all developers to ensure they can run the code identically. 
In the software quality seminars related to dependency management, we covered the following topics: container solutions [@{https://docs.docker.com/}; @{https://apptainer.org/}], R package development, and Anaconda [@{https://www.anaconda.com/}] (**Supplementary Table 2**).
We established a DockerHub account for our group [@{https://hub.docker.com/u/cbgr}] to share our custom containers (**Supplementary Figures**).
This resource enables easy installation of our Snakemake pipelines across different servers.

To summarize, we view the implementation of software quality seminars, code reviews, and shared resources in the academic setting as critical tools to improve coding and to better trust the resulting scientific discoveries.
Nevertheless, we recognize that scientists can choose to implement all or any of them as independent activities.
We observed that even a single activity benefits the members' coding experience and the resulting code quality.
As good practices become routine, the required time investment will decrease, and the benefits will become more apparent.
Finally, the shared knowledge base and standards help new group members adopt good coding practices more quickly.
