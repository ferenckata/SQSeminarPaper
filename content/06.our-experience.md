## Our experiences for development processes involving teams ##

We have seen a variety of suggestions in the literature aiming to improve the status of bioinformatics software.
We recognized that for a single person achieving a good understanding of them all, and subsequently prioritizing, and adopting them would require a substantial amount of time.
Paradoxically, researchers in academia, especially trainees, often work under time pressure, since projects, such as doctoral thesis, have pressing deadlines.
Even basic software quality standards (e.g. standardized environment, independent review of source code) might seem out of scope and impossible to implement for a single researcher.
On the other hand, we also have seen that the industry standard approach heavily relies on a team structure and team management.
Therefore, within our groups, we aimed to create a system where the individual scientific software projects are supported through collective learning, understanding, and discussions.
In this section we describe the practices that we have settled on.

The software development practices that we have adopted can be broadly separated into three categories: 1 - what we have called software quality meetings, 2 - code reviews, and 3 - resource sharing.
We intend these as an exemplary approach for other computational biology groups or institutes of 3 or more bioinformaticians.
However, given the abundance of opinions on this topic, and the variety of challenges bioinformaticians face, we believe that each group should find out what works best for them.

### Software quality meetings ###

Within the framework of software quality meetings, we have established a large-scale knowledge transfer system between the participants.
Presentations and demonstrations of basic concepts, new techniques and tools that are not necessarily tied to a specific project help broaden our knowledge base and awareness.
In this sense, they form almost a substitute for a more formal computer science education, which most bioinformaticians lack [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Topics can arise from literature recommendations, previous education, own projects, code reviews, or effectively be a reproduction of a useful talk or seminar given elsewhere.
The presenters benefit as well by having to research the topic further and present it coherently.
It is not necessary to hold these meetings as regularly as code reviews, especially as the time investment may be taxing for the presenting individual.
However, we recommend keeping them regular, e.g. at least once a month, given the amount of knowledge that can be learnt together (see Table @tbl:sq-recommendations).

The outcomes of these sessions are manifold.
A few examples:

1) a shared vocabulary that enables quick discussion about implementation details and code structures (e.g. object-oriented programming, design patterns, data structures and algorithms);
2) a kind of toolkit and set of recordings we can sample from and build on in our own research projects (e.g. containerization, git features to ease and quicken software development, planning with UML diagrams);
3) awareness of previously unknown packages, improving software performance and quality (e.g. bioframe, S4 object system, R Markdown).

During the software quality meetings, we have also explored the possibility of collaborative projects and pair programming.
We experimented with collaboration on different software tools that are available for all members of the research group and developed by multiple people in the group (see section on Resource sharing).
However, this activity showed to require an additional amount of time we can rarely spare.
A project, where we extensively applied software quality features (object-oriented programming style, user stories when documenting the requirements and assumptions, Jira to add features and report bugs, continuous integration with Git) when working on the same collection code as a team was the latest release of JASPAR database [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkad1059].
From this project experience we concluded that continuous integration is yet to be conquered on bigger software project, but code reviews turned out to be a driver of efficient and quality software development.
However, we want to note that this article in fact was successfully written using a continuous integration based tool Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

### Code reviews ###

The benefits of code reviews have been reviewed in the past [@doi:10.5334/jors.35; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119; @{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
In this text we will briefly summarize how presenting your code and receiving feedback leads to improvement in the process of creating software.
We found that during these meetings implicit peer-pressure helps us achieve most goals: standardization of practices, improved code quality, and enhanced usability of the software.
We would like to note, that the efficiency of these meetings require a shared understanding of the concepts covered during the software quality meetings.
Therefore, we advise starting with learning before discussing the code.

Prior to a scheduled code review, the author is expected to write their code in a way that it will be explainable and understood by others.
This expectation is largely self-inflicted as each person feel the pressure of exposing their weaknesses - even within a friendly environment.
In a large distributed project clean coding style may be trivial, but because the bioinformatic projects are often handled by a single person, it is very possible to make the code complex and obfuscated.
We observed that during data analysis parts of the code are re-run in an ad-hoc manner (e.g. by commenting out or re-writing parts), making it increasingly difficult to explain the code or reproduce the same analysis.

During the code review, the author has to explain some aspect of their code clearly (e.g. structure, algorithm implementation, performance related decisions), which depends on them understanding it.
Trying to explain your code to someone is shown to help with understanding, as with the rubber duck method [@ISBN:9780201616224].
The feedback obtained can help fix existing or potential future issues, improve the implementation, and produce cleaner, more concise code.
The other participants may not be deeply familiar with the particular project, but they have their unique knowledge and point of view.
We agree with the ten simple rules described by Hagan et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119], and note that many of those naturally emerged as a code of conduct after a few rounds of trial and error.
In our settings, it is entirely up to the author to choose which aspect of the code, or software product to discuss.
Although it is implied that participants of code reviews are intended to discuss implementation details, we accept and enjoy discussions about any other aspect of the code, such as user interface design, documentation, or architecture considerations.

After the review, the received suggestions, if crucial, should be implemented swiftly to improve the code before advancing the project.
Some other suggestions (e.g. coding style) do not require instant refactoring, these may be viewed as suggestions for future projects.
At the start of implementation of regular meetings, the recurring comments were about modularization, documentation, and variable declarations, until these became standard among the members.
For example, after about half a year, it was trivial for everyone involved that code organized into functions is preferred over the so-called "spaghetti code".
It is important to note that the success of code review is highly dependent on its frequency.
A long time between reviews means a lot of new code, difficulty to cover all changes in a single session, and potentially a lot of rewrite post review.
This means that code reviews should be as regular and frequent as reasonably possible.
Our groups settled for weekly code review sessions.

Our experience indicates a broader adoption of notions and good software engineering practices highlighted during these code review sessions.
A couple examples will illustrate how code reviews incentivized coding practices and team self-managements aligned with agile prescriptions.
Code review involves some elements of problem-solving, often revisiting fundamental notions of design patterns, algorithms or data structures.
Recurrently we would examine the best strategies to modularize the presented code and discuss what would constitute effective and self-contained computational task and elaborate collectively possible design patterns.
This strengthens the team's overall competency as well as promoting some form of standardization regarding the mental models to use for common tasks and objects solicited in many computational projects.
An important part of the code review process focuses on the compliance with good code practices, and constitutes an explicit attempt at standardization.
This is particularly well illustrated with the review of documentation which goes beyond simple linting.
Effectively this process promotes the adoption of a shared and systematic manner to describe and document the behaviour of the considered tool, which facilitates its intelligibility for a wider audience.
The shared knowledge base and standards also allow us to make new group members adopt good coding practices more quickly.

As a positive additional outcome, we noticed an increasing understanding in each other’s projects that naturally emerged through talking about the analysis code.
This enabled us to give more involved comments during subsequent group meetings too, where we would naturally discuss each other's scientific projects.
Additionally, seeing and analysing everyone's code on a more hands-on level showed us how repetitive some pieces of code can be in different projects.
This redundancy can be removed by implementing a system to share resources.

### Resource sharing ###

Resource sharing boils down to making sure that useful online resources are brought to the attention of all participants easily.
It can be discussed from two perspectives: external open-access resources (forums, repositories, packages and libraries) and internal (within-group resources with tools).
The latter is very important as it allows for team contribution that can benefit the individual project development.
A simple example of this could be a shared repository of various computational tools that were developed by members of the group.
Such tools are universal enough and fit the group’s research questions, so all people in the group can re-use them.
In addition, each tool can be potentially developed and reviewed by multiple group members.

During software meetings, we aimed to set aside time to improve these tools from perspectives identified by the members.
We observed that many of these tools do not have a clear scope and are rather a small script for a sub-task from a previous project.
Based on this observation, we noted that there is a difference between a script and a standalone tool that can be inserted into various projects.
The latter requires exploration of use cases related to the tool, handling of unexpected input, and extensive documentation, to name a few tasks.
This understanding was actually quite relevant in a code review discussion when the expected usage modes of a new tool was the main focus.
We aim to include this knowledge in the upcoming events when a new tool is added to the shared repository.

In sum, software quality meetings, code reviews and shared resources in the research group can be implemented as separate activities choosing all or any of them.
We observed that even a single activity is benefiting members' coding experience and the resulting code quality.
