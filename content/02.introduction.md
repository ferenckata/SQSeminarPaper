## Introduction ##

Bioinformatics and computational biology are indispensable and integral components of research in biology. About 90% of researchers rely on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In turn, scientists heavily rely on computer science and software engineering innovations, such as programming languages, programming paradigms, or container solutions.
However, adopting practices from other fields is complex, and scientific software development in the academic setting tends to lag.
One implication of using outdated or poor software engineering practices is that incorrect software may result in invalid scientific findings [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Even when the software performs as intended, researchers can spend significant time on software building using suboptimal practices.
Such practice results in the concept of technical debt, which translates to increased future time investments in extra efforts, refactoring, and rework [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @{https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html}; @doi:10.1145/2160718.2160733].

Good software development practices (e.g., pair programming and code reviews) are established in other software-heavy fields to mitigate the risk of incorrect software solutions and save development time.
However, scientists, such as bioinformaticians, who work with scientific software often lack formal education in computer science and software development [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412]. This lack of or limited training hinders the adoption of good coding practices.
Moreover, the current funding and academic evaluation frameworks often restrict research projects to being primarily driven by a single trainee.
As a consequence, the limitations of an individual's skills restrict academic software development, which often fails to follow software development guidelines and remains poorly maintained beyond the end of the project [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802].
One way to expand the knowledge and application of good software quality practices is to rely on other experts and leverage complementary knowledge.
We suggest that practices from the field of software development, such as code reviews, can be repurposed as learning opportunities.

In research-oriented environments, what defines a "team" is perceived differently than in software development.
Group members generally discuss and help each other with scientific suggestions, but a single person often designs and implements the code base to address specific scientific questions. <!-- MK: "is designing and implementing" seems to suggest it is just done at a specific instance" -->
<!-- IR: to emphasize the process we should use "implementing" not "implementation" -->
Since adhering to or disregarding software development guidelines typically depends on personal judgment, proper software engineering practice is often considered secondary.
However, when multiple group members develop software, researchers tend to appreciate software engineering concepts [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Notably, larger development teams often enhance communication and software documentation, which are crucial to the success of high-profile code bases. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
The systematic adoption of team coding practices homogenizes the software engineering competence of individuals across the research group and contributes to the dynamism of the research environment.
To summarize, organizing individual bioinformatics in a team structure results in increased validity and reproducibility of scientific findings and improved maintenance of the computational resources for the community [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkad1059; @doi:10.1186/s13059-023-02877-1].

This paper first reviews relevant literature on the individual and team coding practices suggested within and outside scientific research groups.
To overcome the obstacles limiting researchers from adopting good practices, we present our groups' approaches, where we learn, teach, and apply concepts to improve the quality of our software products in a team setting.
We created weekly meetings where group members discuss aspects of software quality relevant to computational biology. Code review sessions complement these meetings to discuss and review the code of our peers.
We suggest that our team-based activities result in shared standards and an overall better code quality with a reduced effort on an individual level.
Furthermore, we offer a framework for initiating collective software development involving members of a bioinformatics group, with and without formal training in software engineering.

We emphasize that collaborative efforts provide a suitable environment to improve software quality in an academic setting. We offer a visual metaphor where improving software quality is similar to a rock climbing exercise, with the top of the rock representing our goal of good quality software (**Figure 1**).
<!-- MK: unsure what you want to say with the word "performant." Maybe "well performing" would be better? Also, consider removing "as is the scope of our teams." In a software Q setting, that is the scope, but the was it is phrased now, it might seem that this is the scope of our research. Alternatively, use "team" instead of "teams," as here you are specifically talking about how you created a "team" that includes members from different research groups.-->
<!-- IR: we should mention the importance of a team. -->
<!-- VK: make sure we mention that we do the reflection on the problem of bad software and we state the reasons why our activities work. -->
To reach this goal, one needs to become proficient in the various concepts depicted by the holds.
These concepts are selected from the literature and our professional experience but are not exhaustive, and each group can tailor them to their specific needs.
The higher they are on the wall, the more advanced we consider the concepts to be.
As the progress is cumulative, we show the holds representing related concepts that build upon each other in the same color.
This way, we mimic traditional computer science education.
The order of visiting the topics can vary between groups, but reiterating certain core concepts (e.g., modularization and testing) is valuable.
Nevertheless, the most crucial point is that rock climbing requires a partner to belay you, just as we believe that other people's input helps us become better programmers.
