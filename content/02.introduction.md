## Introduction {.page_break_before} ##

Bioinformatics and computational biology are continuously gaining importance in biological research.
These fields are heavily relying on inventions of computer science and software engineering.
As Goble pointed out in 2014, about 90% of researchers used or relied on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
She also highlighted that one implication is that incorrect software results in invalid scientific findings.

Good software development practices to mitigate the risk of incorrect software solutions has been established in other software-heavy endeavours.
However, bioinformaticians lack formal education in computer science and related subjects [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Such lack of theoretical and practical foundations hinders the adoption of good practices (e.g. continuous integration, unit tests, code reviews, planning of software architecture).
Indeed, unknown unknowns may include most of the software quality attributes defined by the International Organization for Standardization [@{https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010?limit=3%20}] (Figure @fig:isoSQ-image).

Beyond the limits of individual education, many of these practices rely on redundancy of knowledge within team members, supported by practices such as pair programming, daily stand-up meetings and code reviews.
One main feature of academic research groups is the research projects conducted by a single PhD student or post-doc.
In fact, academia prides itself on enabling individual achievements, and generally measures the success of individual effort while disregarding team effort.
This often results in very few people maintaining the software product, which might be used by thousands of researchers worldwide [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
Lack of funding contributes to the poor maintenance status of much of scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
The lack of funding is being recognized and addressed by few agencies, one of which is the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science fund [@{https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/}].

The concept of a team is therefore different in a science project from a software project.
While group members help each other with scientific suggestions, most often there is a single responsible person for the design and implementation of the code base.
As official guidelines are rarely available on coding practices, the actual craft of software engineering is treated as secondary and up to individual judgment.
These guidelines may naturally emerge in larger groups, following them requires a form of team organization not intrinsic to academic groups.
In line with this, Hannay et al. [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155] found that researchers tended to rank software engineering concepts higher if they worked in a team.
Russel et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898] showed that high-profile code bases feature larger development teams than low-profile ones, and their activities are also associated with longer commit messages as a sign of better communication and documentation of changes.
Relying on these findings, we asked ourselves whether a form of team structure organized around individual software products could improve the quality of our scientific code.

In this work we first review the findings of software engineer researchers on computational scientists, and their suggestions for improving the overall quality of scientific software.
We do not limit our scope to bioinformaticians, as bioiformatics software quality and development practices share many characteristics with scientific software in general.
Next, we review the literature on guidelines posed by bioinformaticians to the bioinformatics community.
These works highlight the priorities within the community.
Noticing the distance between software development practices and academic reality, we also turned to theory on team management.
Finally, we discuss how our research group, inspired by the literature, incorporated weekly discussions on scientific software quality.
Good practice requires investment in time and effort that may not pay off on an individual basis.
Sharing the onboarding effort of new tools, and normalizing discussions on implementation details resulted in an overall better perceived process quality and code quality of the members with a reduced effort on an individual level.
We aim to provide motiviation and framework on how to get started with improving the process quality of bioinformatics groups, even without members who have formal training in computer science or software engineering.
