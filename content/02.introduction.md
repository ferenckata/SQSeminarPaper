## Introduction ##

Bioinformatics and computational biology are indispensable components of research in biology.
About 90% of researchers rely on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In turn, scientists are heavily relying on inventions of computer science and software engineering, such as programming languages, programming paradigms, or container solutions.
However, adopting practices from other fields is not without difficulties and scientific software development tend to lag behind.
One implication of using outdated or poor software engineering practices is that incorrect software results in invalid scientific findings [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Beyond that, even when the software performs as intended, researchers spend significant amount of time on software building using suboptimal practices which can further increase the necessary time investment in the future [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @{https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html}; @doi:10.1145/2160718.2160733].

Good software development practices have been established in other software-heavy endeavours to mitigate the risk of incorrect software solutions and save users' time.
However, bioinformaticians or more generally scientists working with scientific software often lack formal education in computer science or software development [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412].
The hinders the adoption of good coding practices (e.g. unit tests, continuous integration, code reviews).
The software engineering community has defined and described in detail software quality attributes [@{https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010?limit=3%20}], such as functional suitability and performance, which are implicitly prioritized within bioinformatics.
Unfortunately, the more complex concepts, such as usability and reliability, are largely unknown or escapes the attention of individual practising bioinformaticians.
In addition, historically research projects are often carried by a single trainee and are part of academic degree evaluation.
Thus, software, developed for a particular project, is mostly limited to the skills of an individual person and does not necessarily follow all software quality guidelines and can remain poorly maintained after the projects end date [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802].
One way to expand the knowledge and application of good software quality practices is to rely on people around and make use of redundancy of the knowledge, where individual practices are enriched by learning from other people through group activities, such as pair programming or code reviews.

Currently, a team is perceived differently in research-oriented environments compared to the software development projects.
In research groups, members of the group discuss and help each other with scientific suggestions, but most often a single person is designing and implementing the code base to answer scientific questions.
Even though there are plenty of guidelines and suggestions how to start coding or improve the quality of your code, they are mostly targeting individuals, and it is up to them to evaluate the importance of software engineering part of their projects.
Practically it might not be feasible to fulfil a sufficient number of good software quality aspect as an individual due to temporal nature of academic positions, thus software engineering becomes a secondary task in the project.
It was reported previously that researchers tended to rank software engineering concepts higher if they worked in a team [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
High-profile code bases often feature larger development teams and their activities, for example, are marked with longer commit message indicating better communication and documentation of the software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
We hypothesize that a form of team structure organized around individual software products could improve the quality of our scientific code and subsequently increase the validity of scientific findings and their reproducibility.
Systematic adoption of team coding practices homogenizes software engineering competence of individuals across the research group and contributes to the dynamism of the research environment.

In this work we first review relevant literature on the individual and team coding practises that are currently suggested within and outside scientific research groups.
In light of the obstacles preventing or limiting researchers to adopt more good software quality attributes, we present our groups' approach, where in a team setting we learn, teach and apply concepts to improve our software quality.
We have created weekly seminars and code review sessions where group members discuss aspects of software quality relevant for computational biology and show their own code for the rest of the group to discuss and review.
We suggest that our team-based activities result in shared standards and an overall better code quality of the members with a reduced effort on an individual level.
We provide a framework on how to get started with collective software development by directly or indirectly involving all bioinformatician group members, with or without formal training in software engineering.
