## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Bioinformatics and computational biology are continuously gaining importance in biological research. These fields are heavily relying on inventions of computer science and software engineering.
As Goble pointed out in 2014, about 90% of researchers used or relied on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
This implies that incorrect software results in invalid scientific findings.

However, bioinformaticians lack formal education in computer science and related subjects [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Such lack of theoretical and practical foundations hinders the adoption of good practices (e.g. continuous integration, unit tests, code reviews, planning of software architecture) established in other software-heavy endeavours.
Many of these practices rely on redundancy of knowledge within team members, supported by practices such as pair programming, daily stand-up meetings and code reviews.

One main feature of academic research groups is the research projects conducted by a single PhD student or post-doc.
In fact, academia prides itself on enabling individual achievements, and generally measures the success of individual effort while disregarding team effort.
This often results in very few people maintaining the software product, which might be used by thousands of researchers worldwide [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
Lack of funding contributes to the poor maintenance status of much of scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88], which has been recognized and addressed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science fund [@{https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/}].

The concept of a team is therefore different in a science project from a software project.
While group members help each other with scientific suggestions, most often there is a single responsible person for the design and implementation of the code base.
As official guidelines are rarely available on coding practices, the actual craft of software engineering is treated as secondary and up to individual judgment.
We can observe (<span style="background-color: yellow">can we?</span>) that these guidelines naturally emerge in larger groups (<span style="background-color: yellow">Seurat?</span>), this requires a form of team organization not intrinsic to academic groups.
In line with this, Hannay et al. [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155] found that researchers tended to rank software engineering concepts higher if they worked in a team.
Russel et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898] showed that high-profile code bases feature larger development teams than low-profile ones, and their activities are also associated with longer commit messages as a sign of better communication and documentation of changes.
We asked ourselves whether a form of team structure organized around individual software products could improve the quality of our work.

In this work we review the findings of software engineer researchers on bioinformatics practitioners, and their suggestions for improving the overall quality of scientific software in bioinformatics and related fields (<span style="background-color: yellow">citations?</span>).
Inspired by the findings, especially related to process quality, our research group incorporated weekly discussions on code quality.
We noticed that good practice requires investment in time and effort that may not pay off on an individual basis.
Sharing the onboarding effort of new tools, and normalizing discussions on implementation details resulted in an overall better perceived process quality and code quality of the members.

We implemented a form of code review that fits our specific needs and context.
We used our experience from these sessions, with special focus on team-based software development practices ensuring good code quality during in the update of the curation analysis software of the 2024 release of the JASPAR database (<span style="background-color: yellow">citation</span>).
In this project, as well as in some of our own individual research projects, we introduced user stories when documenting the assumptions, current features and new ideas, and we relied on development tools such as Jira and git.
We note that the usage of these tools is not necessarily aligned with industry practices, due to the experimental nature of scientific software.
Nevertheless, as bioinformatics becomes a more and more software-heavy field, we believe a good direction is to collectively lower the barrier to adapting to new technologies.

We aim to provide guidelines on how to get started with improving the process quality of bioinformatics groups, even without members who have formal training in computer science or software engineering.
