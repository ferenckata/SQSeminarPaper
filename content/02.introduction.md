## Introduction ##

Bioinformatics and computational biology are indispensable components of research in biology.
About 90% of researchers rely on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In turn, scientists are heavily relying on inventions of computer science and software engineering, such as programming languages, programming paradigms, or container solutions.
However, adopting practices from other fields is not without difficulties and scientific software development tends to lag behind.
One implication of using outdated or poor software engineering practices is that incorrect software results in invalid scientific findings [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Beyond that, even when the software performs as intended, researchers spend significant amount of time on software building using suboptimal practices which can further increase the necessary time investment in the future [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @{https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html}; @doi:10.1145/2160718.2160733].

Good software development practices (e.g. pair programming, code reviews) have been established in other software-heavy endeavours to mitigate the risk of incorrect software solutions and save development time.
However, bioinformaticians or more generally scientists working with scientific software often lack formal education in computer science or software development [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412].
This hinders the adoption of good coding practices (e.g. unit tests, continuous integration).
In addition, historically research projects are often carried by a single trainee and are part of academic degree evaluation.
Thus, software developed for a particular project is mostly limited to the skills of an individual person, does not follow many software development guidelines, and can remain poorly maintained after the end of the project [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802].
One way to expand the knowledge and application of good software quality practices is to rely on people around and make use of redundancy of the knowledge.
We suggest that software development practices, such as pair programming or code reviews, can be repurposed as learning opportunities.

Currently, a team is perceived differently in research-oriented environments compared to the software development projects.
In research groups, members of the group discuss and help each other with scientific suggestions, but most often a single person is designing and implementing the code base to answer scientific questions.
Without shared standards, the available guidelines on coding practices are only suggestive and often anecdotal.
As following or ignoring these guidelines is up to individual judgment, the actual craft of software engineering is often treated as an afterthought.
However, when software is developed by multiple group members, researchers tend to appreciate software engineering concepts [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
High-profile code bases often feature larger development teams and their activities indicates better communication and documentation of the software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
To summarize, systematic adoption of team coding practices homogenizes software engineering competence of individuals across the research group and contributes to the dynamism of the research environment.
We hypothesize that a form of team structure organized around individual software products could improve the quality of our scientific code.
According to the literature, we expected an increased validity and reproducibility of scientific findings, as well as better maintenance of our computational resources for the community [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkad1059; @doi:10.1186/s13059-023-02877-1].

In this work we first review relevant literature on the individual and team coding practices that are currently suggested within and outside scientific research groups.
To overcome the obstacles limiting researchers to adopt good practices, we present our groups' approach, where in a team setting we learn, teach, and apply concepts to improve the quality of our software products.
We have created weekly meetings and code review sessions where group members discuss aspects of software quality relevant for computational biology and show their own code for the rest of the group to discuss and review.
We suggest that our team-based activities result in shared standards and an overall better code quality of the members with a reduced effort on an individual level.
Furthermore, we provide a framework on how to get started with collective software development by directly or indirectly involving all bioinformatician group members, with or without formal training in software engineering.
