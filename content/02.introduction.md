## Introduction ##

Bioinformatics and computational biology are continuously gaining importance in biological research.
These fields are heavily relying on inventions of computer science and software engineering.
About 90% of researchers rely on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
One implication of poor software engineering practices is that incorrect software results in invalid scientific findings [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Beyond that, even when the software performs as intended, researchers spend significant amount of time on software building using suboptimal practices which can further increase the necessary time investment in the future [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848]. Saving time in early development at the expense of future maintenance is known (in the software engineering literature) as accumulation of technical debt [@{https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html}; @doi:10.1145/2160718.2160733].

Good software development practices mitigating the risk of incorrect software solutions has been established in other software-heavy endeavours.
However, bioinformaticians or more generally scientists working with scientific software often lack formal education in computer science or software development [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412].
Such lack of theoretical and practical foundations hinders the adoption of good coding practices (e.g. software architecture planning, continuous integration, unit tests, code reviews).
Indeed, the software quality attributes defined by the International Organization for Standardization may be summarized into the "unknown unknowns" for bioinformaticians [@{https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010?limit=3%20}].
For example, reliability of the software should ensure that the expected output is always produced by the software, which maintainability should allow for easy inspection, update and testing of the software.

Beyond the limits of individual education, many of these practices rely on redundancy of knowledge within team members, supported by practices such as pair programming, daily stand-up meetings and code reviews.
In contrast, historically academic research projects are mostly driven by a single person (a PhD student or a post-doc) as these projects are often part of academic degree evaluation.
Sadly, academic world still often tends to disregard the team effort, priding itself on enabling individual achievements and career progression instead.
Taking this into account, with one (or very few) person developing the software for a project, scientific software remains poorly maintained even if it is used by a significant number of researchers worldwide [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802].
The concept of a team is therefore different in a research-oriented project compared to a software development project.
While the group members help each other with scientific suggestions, most often there is a single responsible person for the design and implementation of the code base.
As official guidelines on coding practices are rarely definitive, but rather suggestive, the actual craft of software engineering is treated as secondary task and is often up to individual judgment.
These guidelines may naturally emerge in larger groups, if software is used or even developed by multiple group members.
It is not always obvious that to follow them requires a form of team organization not intrinsic to academic groups.
To highlight the team aspect, it was reported previously that researchers tended to rank software engineering concepts higher if they worked in a team [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
High-profile code bases often feature larger development teams and their activities are marked with longer commit messaged indicating better communication and documentation of the software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
We hypothesize that the form of team structure organized around individual software products could improve the quality of our scientific code.

The next, almost natural, question related to better maintenance of scientific software in academia is funding.
It is notoriously hard to attract funding for existing scientific software, which contributes to the poor maintenance status of much of scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
Fortunately in recent years, the lack of funding is being recognized and addressed by few agencies, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science fund [@{https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/}].
These initiatives are great examples of how our views towards scientific software should be updated.
Scientific community and funding agencies should welcome the efforts of maintaining original software and encourage its updates instead of development of new software that risks remaining unmaintained.
Development and maintenance of scientific software can be improved by taking into account good software practices.
This can be implemented in research groups by creating a teamwork atmosphere where trainees and staff are directly or indirectly working on the same software.

In this work we first analyse how software engineers are evaluating the computational scientists (emphasizing, but not limiting to bioinformatics) and what suggestions they give to improve the overall quality of software.
In addition, we review the literature on guidelines posed by bioinformaticians to the bioinformatics community to summarize the current software standards and priorities circulating in the community.
To better understand the team work aspect, we present the main aspect of team management.
Finally, we present and discuss how our research groups, motivated and inspired by current software quality state, created weekly sessions to practically discuss and learn to incorporate different aspects of software quality.
Good practices require investment in time and effort that may not feasible to fulfill as an individual (for example, having limited time perform and to deliver doctoral thesis).
However, we suggest that sharing the existing software knowledge base in the group, learning new tool development and implementation together and, more importantly, normalizing showing and discussing code results in an overall better code quality of the members with a reduced effort on an individual level.
We aim to provide a motivation and framework on how to get started with a setting, where code can be developed in a team setting directly or indirectly involving all group members with or without formal training in software engineering.
