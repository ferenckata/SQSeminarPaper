## Introduction ##

Bioinformatics and computational biology are continuously gaining importance in biological research.
About 90% of researchers rely on results produced by scientific software [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
In turn, scientists are heavily relying on inventions of computer science and software engineering, such as programming languages, programming paradigms, or container solutions.
However, adopting practices from other fields is not without difficulties and scientific software development tend to lag behind.
One implication of using outdated or poor software engineering practices is that incorrect software results in invalid scientific findings [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Beyond that, even when the software performs as intended, researchers spend significant amount of time on software building using suboptimal practices which can further increase the necessary time investment in the future [@doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @{https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html}; @doi:10.1145/2160718.2160733].

Good software development practices have been established in other software-heavy endeavours to mitigate the risk of incorrect software solutions.
However, bioinformaticians or more generally scientists working with scientific software often lack formal education in computer science or software development [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155; @doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412].
The lack of theoretical and practical foundations hinders the adoption of good coding practices (e.g. unit tests, continuous integration, code reviews).
To prioritize good practices, it is beneficial to know about the target qualities a software may have.
Although the software engineering community has defined software quality attributes [@{https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010?limit=3%20}], these are largely unknown to practising bioinformaticians.
Among these attributes are functional suitability and performance, which are implicitly prioritized within bioinformatics.
On the other hand, the list also contains usability, reliability, maintainability, and portability, which are implicitly neglected in most bioinformatics endeavour.
The consequences of this implicit prioritization is that the default behaviour (i.e. producing prototype software) does not change even when the scope of the software product changes.

Beyond the limits of individual education, many of the good software practices rely on redundancy of knowledge within team members, supported by practices such as pair programming, regular stand-up meetings, and code reviews.
In contrast, historically, academic research projects are mostly driven by a single person (a PhD student or a post-doc) and these projects are often part of the academic degree evaluation.
Unfortunately for software development purposes, the academic world still often tends to disregard the team effort, priding itself on enabling individual achievements and career progression instead.
Taking this into account, with one (or very few) person developing the software for a project, scientific software remains poorly maintained even if it is used by a significant number of researchers worldwide [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.10.483804; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1145/1852786.1852802].

The concept of a team is therefore different in a research-oriented project compared to a software development project.
While the group members help each other with scientific suggestions, most often there is a single person responsible for the design and implementation of the code base.
As official guidelines on coding practices are rarely definitive, but rather suggestive, the actual craft of software engineering is treated as secondary task and is often up to individual judgment.
These guidelines may naturally emerge in larger groups, if software is used or even developed by multiple group members.
It was reported previously that researchers tended to rank software engineering concepts higher if they worked in a team [@doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
High-profile code bases often feature larger development teams and their activities are marked with longer commit messaged indicating better communication and documentation of the software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0205898].
However, it is not always obvious that to follow the guidelines requires a form of team organization not intrinsic to academic groups.
We hypothesize that a form of team structure organized around individual software products could improve the quality of our scientific code.
We further argue that the heterogeneous codebase quality observed across research environments doesn't reflect the quality of the research work itself, but rather results from the chance coincidence of varyingly trained researchers.
In this manuscript we show that one effective path to systematically improve the codebase quality for any research environment is the adoption of team coding practices, as these average-out circumstancial variations in software engineering competence and contribute to the dynamism of the research environment.

In this work we start with a literature review on the concepts we build on.
First, we present guidelines suggested by both software engineers evaluating the computational scientists (emphasizing, but not limiting to bioinformatics), and bioinformaticians.
Thus, we obtain an external and internal view on the envisioned standards and priorities for the bioinformatics community.
Next, we explore the main aspect of team management established in non-academic software development settings.
Finally, we describe and discuss how our research groups, motivated by personal experience of working with scientific software and inspired by the literature, created weekly sessions to discuss and learn different aspects of software quality relevant for computational biology.

We find that good practices require investment in time and effort that may not be feasible to fulfil as an individual (e.g. having limited time to perform and to deliver doctoral thesis).
However, we suggest that our practices results in shared standards and an overall better code quality of the members with a reduced effort on an individual level.
These practices include sharing the existing software knowledge base in the group, learning new tool development and implementation together, and normalizing showing and discussing code.
We thus aim to provide a motivation and framework on how to get started with collective software development by directly or indirectly involving all bioinformatician group members, with or without formal training in software engineering.
