## SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS ##  

Following the standard methods of literature review, here we list the phrases and platforms of search. The literature search was performed in multiple iterations using Google (to include grey literature), PubMed and Google Scholar based on phrases “guidelines for bioinformatics software”, “rules for biologists learning bioinformatics”, "scientific software development", "software engineering bioinformatics" and "bioinformatics software recommendations" throughout 2023. Additionally, relevant articles were selected based on the snowball effect from the references of the initial publications.
