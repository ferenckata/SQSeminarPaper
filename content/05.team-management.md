## Coding in teams ##

Beyond the brief mention of getting support in the guidelines for bioinformaticians, specialized literature exists that examines how to effectively organize coding activities in a team.
Programming as a collective practice is a key notion in software engineering.
A central theme in this literature is maximizing team cohesion while minimizing code coupling [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
From perspective of the code, adoption of sound software design enforcing modularity and extensibility ensures the viability of a software project [@ISBN:0932633420].
From the perspective of the development, team management practices centred around communication and collective governance are preferred [@ISBN:0932633420].

In general, we understand management as performing a set of tasks: planning, monitoring resources, and tracking progression [@{https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-software-project-management/}].
Typically, the oversight of these functions would be taken up by a single individual referred to as the “manager” of a project, where manager is a role rather than a title of a particular person.
In the particular context of computational projects in academia, a strict division of labour is rarely found in regard to the management of software projects.
Some tasks, such as risk, budget and time management, are discussed at the conception of the project (e.g. during grant application) and thus decoupled from the actual software development phase.
The remaining management tasks would often fall on the developer(s).
Implicit decision-making is one of the key challenges current bioinformatics projects face.

As agile is the only recommendation about team management present in these guidelines (**Table 1**), we discuss it here in light of the current academic practices.
Through more team communication, one outstanding aim of agile is the aspiration for more autonomy in organizing the work of software developers.
Practices and methods aligned with agile prescriptions include planning a minimum viable product, documenting requirements, organizing stand-up meetings, defining and assigning tasks, pair-programming, and code reviews.
Many of these practices do not require the presence of the manager, but assume a collegial work culture and standardized procedures.
The additional overhead in terms of time and resources needed when developing is offset by the aforementioned benefits in terms of software resilience and improved team capabilities.

Incentivizing a collective ownership and governance of the codebase as a whole, promotes the adoption of software engineering best practices among developers contributing to a software project [@doi:10.1016/j.infsof.2009.11.004].
Indeed, by aspiring to make any developer within the team interchangeable across the various ongoing tasks, we create the need for robust testing, comprehensive documentation and coherence across the difference parts of the project [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Furthermore, by exposing every developer to a variety of tasks over the course of the project development, we strengthen the knowledge and skill base of the team as a whole, as well as create a better mutual awareness of team member expertise.
This mutual awareness is known as transactive memory system, and has been linked to increased team performance [@doi:10.1177/1046496420967764].
Taken together these merits further improve the team's capacity to overcome technical challenges that will arise over the course of the development process.

We do not believe that all the software engineering guidelines employed in the industry are necessarily relevant to the production of scientific software.
The circumstances differ significantly, mainly due to how the outcomes of research projects (papers, tools, protocols, etc.) need to be credited to particular individual researchers for their career progression.
Regardless of the optimality of this situation, personal projects remain the norm, and it would be futile to expect another group member to achieve an equal level of familiarity with one's project.
However, this should not prevent interactions between the people in the group, as it is through these interactions that rules are enforced and quality increased.
To reach reliability, performance and extensibility it is more important to collaborate with people and individual software quality attributes will be more comfortably handled even if we as individuals do not have a capacity to touch upon every single one of them.

In our research groups, we have practically implemented the environment in which we, as a group, learn about and implement software quality practices that have been discussed in literature.
We want to share this experience and propose how simple additions, such as weekly code review sessions or seminars, can lead to the improved quality of collective or personal software.
