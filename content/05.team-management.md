### Review of team management literature in the context of software engineering

Programing as a collective practice is a key notion in software engineering, which prompted a corresponding rich literature examining how to effectively organise it. A central theme in this literature is the combination of maximising team cohesion while minimising code coupling. They (<span style="background-color: yellow">who? citation needed</span>) argue that the viability of the successive phases of a software development project is largely determined by the adoption of sound software design enforcing modularity and extensibility coupled with team management practices centered around communication and collective governance.

Before delving into more specific recomendations, let us first define the scope of what constitutes management. We understand management as the set of tasks ensuring the viability of a software project. These tasks revolve around planning, monitoring resources, and tracking progression. Typically these functions would be taken up by a single individual referred to as the “manager” of a project. In the particular context of computational projects in academia, such a strict division of labour is rarely found with regards to software development. Often, these aspects would be deliberated by the developer(s), eventually reaching a consensus on the desired way forward and acted upon. This sort of self-management, at times collective, is analogous to some of the prescriptions of the SCRUM method. 

- Agile method and SCRUM framework
    - SCRUM is a framework to perform these management tasks through team self-management. SCRUM was introduced to respond to the aspiration for more autonomy and responsivity from software developers best illustrated by the agile manifesto. This proposition was a reaction to the typical blueprint-like management for engineering projects which proved ineffective (source -> long crisis of agile)
