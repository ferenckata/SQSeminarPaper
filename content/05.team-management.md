## Coding in team from software engineering perspective ##

Beyond the brief mentioning of getting support or coding in a team in guidelines for bioinformaticians, there is specialized literature that examines how to effectively organize coding activities in a team.
Programming as a collective practice is a key notion in software engineering.
A central theme in this literature is maximizing team cohesion while minimizing code coupling [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Authors (<span style="background-color: yellow">citation needed</span>) argue that the viability of a software project along it successive development phases is largely determined by the adoption of sound software design enforcing modularity and extensibility coupled with team management practices centred around communication and collective governance.

In general, we understand management as the set of tasks ensuring the viability of a software project.
These tasks revolve around planning, monitoring resources, and tracking progression [@{https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-software-project-management/}].
Typically, the overseeing of these functions would be taken up by a single individual referred to as the “manager” of a project.
In the particular context of computational projects in academia, a strict division of labour is rarely found in regard to the management of software projects.
This means that the management and execution of a software project falls into the hands of the same person.
Furthermore, some tasks, such as risk, budget and time management and maintenance are decoupled from the actual software development phase.
The remaining management tasks would often be deliberated by the developer(s), eventually reaching a consensus on the desired way forward and acted upon.
This sort of self-management, at times collective, echoes some prescriptions of the SCRUM method [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
SCRUM is a framework to perform these management tasks through team self-management.
This framework was introduced to respond to the aspiration for more autonomy and responsivity from software developers, best illustrated by the agile manifesto [@{https://agilemanifesto.org/}].
This proposition was a reaction to the typical blueprint-like management for engineering projects which proved ineffective in addressing the emerging challenges of large software projects [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
The similarity is probably the reason why agile practices are part of guidelines for scientific software developers (Table @tbl:sq-recommendations).

One outstanding aim of agile is the aspiration for more autonomy for organizing the work of software developers.
In the particular context of large computational project, agile opened the opportunity for collective governance and a move away from a project structure producing a division of labour coupling one developer to a particular task or aspect indefinitely.
Incentivizing a collective ownership and governance of the codebase as a whole, promotes the adoption of software engineering best practices among developers contributing to a software project [@doi:10.1016/j.infsof.2009.11.004].
Indeed, by aspiring to make any developer within the team interchangeable across the various ongoing tasks, we create the need for robust testing, comprehensive documentation and coherence across the difference parts of the project [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Furthermore, by exposing every developer to a variety of tasks over the course of the project development, we strengthen the knowledge and skill base of the team as a whole, as well as create a better mutual awareness of team member expertise (transactive memory system [@doi:10.1177/1046496420967764]).
Taken together these merits further improve the team's capacity to overcome technical challenges that will arise over the course of the development process.

The previous paragraph outlined some desirable outcomes of agile-like practices.
Such benefits require the implementation and effective adoption of this mode of project management.
In turn, it relies on the execution of a variety of methods whose success in realizing the merits of agile depends heavily on setting the adequate circumstances for the team to need to incorporate elements of agile in their regular work practice.
Practices and methods aligned with agile prescriptions include stand-up meetings, task allocations, pair-programming, or code reviews.
Note, that many of these practices do not require the presence of the manager, but assumes a work culture and standardized procedures.
At their core, these practices incentivize continuous communication and collective decision-making among developers.
This constitutes an additional overhead in terms of time and resources needed when developing, but this is offset by the aforementioned benefits in terms of coding practice, software resilience and improved team capabilities.

In our research groups, we have practically implemented the environment in which we, as a group, learn about and implement software quality practices that have been discussed in literature.
We want to share this experience and propose how simple additions, such as weekly code review sessions or seminars, can lead to improved quality collective or personal software.
