## Coding in teams #

Beyond the brief mention of getting support in the guidelines for bioinformaticians, specialized literature examines how to organize team coding activities effectively.
Indeed, programming as a collective practice is a critical notion in software engineering.
Maximizing team cohesion while minimizing code coupling represents a central theme  [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
From the code's perspective, the adoption of sound software design enforcing modularity and extensibility ensures the viability of a software project [@ISBN:0932633420].
Nevertheless, from a software development perspective, one should prefer team management practices centered around communication and collective governance [@ISBN:0932633420].

We generally understand management as performing specific tasks: planning, monitoring resources, and tracking progression [@{https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-software-project-management/}].
Typically, a single individual, referred to as the "manager" of the project, takes on these functions. In this context, manager is a role rather than a particular person's title.
In the specific context of academic computational projects, one rarely finds a strict division of labor when considering software project management.
Some tasks, such as risk assessment, budget, and time management, are discussed at the project's conception (e.g., during grant application) and thus decoupled from the actual software development phase.
The remaining management tasks would often fall on the developer(s). Implicit decision-making is one of the critical challenges current bioinformatics projects face.

As agile is the primary recommendation for team management in these guidelines (**Table 1**), its relevance to academic settings is worth discussing. Agile methodologies, which emphasize iterative development, regular feedback, and flexibility, could significantly improve the way teams handle the evolving demands and rapid changes typical in academic computational projects. Through more team communication, one outstanding aim of agile is the aspiration for more autonomy in organizing the work of software developers.
Practices and methods aligned with agile prescriptions include planning a minimum viable product, documenting requirements, organizing stand-up meetings, defining and assigning tasks, pair programming, and code reviews.
Many of these practices do not require the manager's presence but assume a collegial work culture and standardized procedures.
The additional overhead in terms of time and resources needed when developing is offset by the benefits mentioned above regarding software resilience and improved team capabilities.

Incentivizing collective ownership and governance promotes the adoption of software engineering best practices among developers contributing to a software project [@doi:10.1016/j.infsof.2009.11.004].
Indeed, by aspiring to make any developer within the team interchangeable across the various ongoing tasks, we create the need for robust testing, comprehensive documentation, and coherence across the different parts of the project [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Furthermore, by exposing every developer to various tasks throughout the project development, one strengthens the knowledge and skill base of the team as a whole, as well as creates an improved mutual awareness of team member expertise.
This mutual awareness, known as transactive memory system, is linked to increased team performance @doi:10.1177/1046496420967764.
These merits further improve the team's capacity to overcome technical challenges that will arise throughout the development process.

[comment]: AM: I am not sure the previous paragraph conveys the right point. I agree that it is great to have multiple developers on one project, we know (and it is acknowledged above) that, in academia, projects are mostly a one-person's job. While the team effort conveyed so far was about getting together to improve each other, it is different from working together on a single project. You acknowledge that below, but I feel that the transition could be smoother. Not sure how to do it though.

We do not believe that all the software engineering guidelines employed in the industry are necessarily relevant to producing scientific software in academia.
Indeed, the circumstances differ significantly, mainly due to how the outcomes of research projects (papers, tools, protocols, etc.) need to be credited to particular individual researchers for their career progression.
Regardless of the optimality of this situation, personal projects remain the norm, and it would be futile to expect another group member to achieve an equal level of familiarity with one's project.
However, this should not prevent interactions between developers of distinct projects, as these interactions will ensure compliance with the rules and increase quality.
It is crucial to collaborate to achieve reliability, performance, and extensibility. By working together, we can more effectively manage individual software quality attributes, even if we may not be able to address every single one individually.

In our research groups, we have implemented the environment in which we, as a group, learn about and implement the software quality practices discussed above.
We want to share this experience and propose how simple additions, such as weekly code review sessions or seminars, can improve the quality of collective or personal software.
