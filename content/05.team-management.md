### Review of team management literature in the context of software engineering

Programing as a collective practice is a key notion in software engineering, which prompted a corresponding rich literature examining how to effectively organise it.
A central theme in this literature is the combination of maximising team cohesion while minimising code coupling. Miriam Posner [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}] argues that the viability of the successive phases of a software development project is largely determined by the adoption of sound software design enforcing modularity and extensibility coupled with team management practices centered around communication and collective governance.

Before delving into more specific recomendations, let us first define the scope of what constitutes management.
We understand management as the set of tasks ensuring the viability of a software project.
These tasks revolve around planning, monitoring resources, and tracking progression.
Typically these functions would be taken up by a single individual referred to as the “manager” of a project.
In the particular context of computational projects in academia, such a strict division of labour is rarely found with regards to software development.
Often, these aspects would be deliberated by the developer(s), eventually reaching a consensus on the desired way forward and acted upon.
This sort of self-management, at times collective, is analogous to some of the prescriptions of the SCRUM method [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
This analogy was probably the reason agile practices are part of guidelines for scientific software developers (Table @tbl:sq-recommendations).

- Agile method and SCRUM framework
    - SCRUM is a framework to perform these management tasks through team self-management. SCRUM was introduced to respond to the aspiration for more autonomy and responsivity from software developers best illustrated by the agile manifesto. This proposition was a reaction to the typical blueprint-like management for engineering projects which proved ineffective (source -> long crisis of agile)

Let us not forget that academia comes from a different place than where agile was developed.
The Agile Manifesto was written against "bureaucracy, infantilization, and sense of futility" [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
The academic software development agile practices would in fact be a more stringent approach to software development than current practices.
This is important, because most literature pictures agile as management free from traditional management.
We should not forget that ad-hoc coding does not comply with agile, and we cannot use it as an excuse to continue our current practices.
The agile system assumes that software engineering professionals seek to find the best approaches, and are well equiped to make good decisions on their own - when faced with shifting requirements and complex code base [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
Additionally, the lack of top-to-bottom management, architects and system analysts in academic software development put even more responsibility on the individual developer.
However, as noted in previous sections, current scientific software developer education does not necessarily cover these elements [@doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44].
