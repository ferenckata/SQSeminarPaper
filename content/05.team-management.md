## Coding in teams #

Beyond the brief mention of getting support in the guidelines for bioinformaticians, specialized literature examines how to organize team coding activities effectively.
Indeed, programming as a collective practice is a critical notion in software engineering.
Maximizing team cohesion while minimizing code coupling represents a central theme  [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
From a code writing perspective, the adoption of sound software design enforcing modularity and extensibility ensures the viability of a software project [@ISBN:0932633420].
Nevertheless, from a software development perspective, one should prefer team management practices centered around communication and collective governance [@ISBN:0932633420]. <!-- To me, "from the code's perspective" sounds really strange. "From a software development perspective" does make sense. Unsure if you like my edit, so feel free to change to something better -->

We generally understand management as performing specific tasks: planning, monitoring resources, and tracking progression [@{https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-software-project-management/}].
Typically, a single individual, referred to as the "manager" of the project, takes on these functions.
In this context, manager is a role rather than a particular person's title.
In the specific context of academic computational projects, one rarely finds a strict division of labor when considering software project management.
Some tasks, such as risk assessment, budget, and time management, are discussed at the project's conception (e.g., during grant application) and thus decoupled from the actual software development phase.
The remaining management tasks would often fall on the developer(s).
Implicit decision-making is one of the critical challenges current bioinformatics projects face.

As agile is the primary recommendation for team management in these guidelines (**Table 1**), its relevance to academic settings is worth discussing.
Agile methodologies, which emphasize iterative development, regular feedback, and flexibility, could significantly improve how teams handle the evolving demands and rapid changes typical in academic computational projects.
Through more team communication, one outstanding aim of agile method development is the aspiration for more autonomy in organizing the work of software developers.
Practices and methods aligned with agile prescriptions include planning a minimum viable product, documenting requirements, organizing stand-up meetings, defining and assigning tasks, pair programming, and code reviews.
Many of these practices do not require the manager's presence but assume a collegial work culture and standardized procedures.
The additional overhead in terms of time and resources needed when developing is offset by the benefits mentioned above regarding software resilience and improved team capabilities.

Incentivizing collective ownership and governance promotes the adoption of software engineering best practices among developers contributing to a software project [@doi:10.1016/j.infsof.2009.11.004].
Indeed, by aspiring to make any developer within the team interchangeable across the various ongoing tasks, we create an environment for robust testing, comprehensive documentation, and coherence across the project's different parts @{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}. <!-- I didn't get why "the need" was used here. By collectively training each other, we don't create a need to test software, we rather facilitate this -->
Furthermore, by exposing every developer to various tasks throughout the project development, one strengthens the knowledge and skill base of the team as a whole and creates an improved mutual awareness of each team member's expertise. <!-- as you have "mutual awareness" this phrasing is clearer -->
This mutual awareness, which can be thought of as a ``transactive memory system,'' is linked to increased team performance [@doi:10.1177/1046496420967764].  <!-- it is not clear why "the transactive memory system" part is included. I tried to make this clear as I understand it, but please edit as needed. -->

These merits further improve the team's capacity to overcome technical challenges that will likely arise throughout the development process.
We do not believe that all the software engineering guidelines employed in the industry are necessarily relevant to producing scientific software in academia.
Indeed, the environments differ significantly, mainly due to the variation in outcomes of research projects (papers, tools, protocols, etc.), and due to the fact that the academic system encourages crediting of individual researchers to aid their career progression.
However, this should not prevent interactions between developers of distinct projects, as these interactions will ensure compliance with the rules and increase software quality.
Our proposition of building a learning community centered on coding is our attempt to bridge the gap between the merits of coding in teams and the reality of individually credited projects in the academic setting.

In our research groups, we have implemented an environment in which we, as a group, learn about and implement the software quality practices discussed above.
In the remainder of this work, we share this experience and propose how simple additions, such as weekly code review sessions or seminars, can improve software quality. <!--  I removed it as "personal software sounds strange to me. Is this a concept from software engineering? If you want to highlight the "collective" and "individual" part here, that can be done, but then it needs to be a bit clearer. I do not think that is needed though, as this sentence just introduces what we will describe in the sections below. -->
