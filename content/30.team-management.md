### Review of team management litterature in the context of software engineering
- Programing as a collective practice is a key notion in software engineering, which prompted a corresponding rich litterature relating to how to effectively organising it. A central theme in this litterature is the injonction to maximise team cohesion while minimising code coupling. 
- More specifically, this litterature highlights how in the course of the successive phases of a software project development, the viability of the outcome is largely determined by the adoption of sound software design revolving around modularity and extensibility coupled with team management practices centered around redundancy and cohesion.
- Scope of management tasks
    - The basic management tasks, ensuring the viability of a software project at the development level, revolve around planning, monitoring resources and tracking progression. Typically these functions would be taken up by a single individual referred to as the “manager” of a project. In the particular context of software projects in academia, such a strict division of labour is rarely found. Often ,these aspects would be deliberated by the collaborators/developers among themselves, eventually reaching a consensus on the desired way forward.This sort of team self-management is analogous to some of the prescriptions of the SCRUM method. 

- Agile method and SCRUM framework
    - SCRUM is a framework to perform these management tasks through team self-management. SCRUM was introduced to respond to the aspiration for more autonomy and responsivity from software developers. This proposition was a reaction to the Typical blueprint-like management for engineering projects proved ineffective (source -> long crisis of agile)
