## Conclusions and Future Perspectives ##

As bioinformatics becomes a more and more software-heavy field, we believe a good direction is to collectively lower the barrier to adapting to new technologies.
Working in a team and following standards is not an option for large software projects that support many researchers and contribute to novel findings.
We argue that following good software quality practices and mimicking team structure also benefit small projects.
The overall performance increases when team members are familiar with each other and together build problem-solving routines through cumulative experience [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
In a group, the knowledge of who knows what speeds up problem-solving [@doi:10.1177/1046496420967764]; time spent together, and social factors ease technical knowledge transfer [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Therefore, we motivate all group leaders with a computational component, be it small or not, to build an environment for their trainees to communicate and discuss software quality aspects.

We envision a future where scientific software for core applications is appreciated, reliable, and actively maintained.
All scientists would benefit from a strong backbone of software solutions that would support quick and efficient prototyping and the maturation of working solutions.
Unfortunately, we recognize that the lack of funding for software maintenance prevents achieving a level of software quality that would inspire confidence in the results [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
Funding agencies, often through peer reviewers, emphasize "novelty" by enforcing new software development.
This focus can make it difficult to justify dedicating time to the maintenance of software or computational resources that offer limited scientific output, especially when considering journal publications as the only token of success.
As Alexander Szalay puts it, "the funding stops when researchers develop the software prototype" [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01901-x].
Researchers want to build on each other's findings and use published novel software as tools, but they might need to spend a significant amount of time adopting or maintaining that software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
The scientific ecosystem would benefit from funding earmarked for maintenance and dedicating time to it in project proposals.
On a positive note, a few agencies, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Essential Open Source Software for Science fund @{https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/}, and the Schmidt Futures through their Virtual Institute of Scientific Software [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01901-x], have recognized this missed opportunity. They are starting to address the lack of funding in this aspect.
The scientific community and funding agencies should welcome the efforts of maintaining original software and encourage its updates instead of the development of replacement software with the risk of remaining unmaintained.

To summarize, it is of utmost importance for the scientific community to recognize the limitations of the software it produces and to acknowledge the flaws in the coding process.
To harness the potential for substantial improvement, we recommend that scientific groups and institutions organize three pillar activities: software quality seminars, code review sessions, and the implementation of resource sharing.
These initiatives will engage members of research groups in one anotherâ€™s projects, facilitating the practical exchange of knowledge and feedback on code and beyond.
Finally, we strongly advocate for sustainable funding to maintain existing scientific software and recognize software that adheres to best practices.
