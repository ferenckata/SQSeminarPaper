### Review of existing suggestions for improving software quality in biomedical sciences ###

We reviewed the existing literature that focuses on providing guidelines for programming practices for scientists without extensive training in computational sciences.
We used several key phrases to search for papers: “guidelines for bioinformatics software”, “rules for biologists learning bioinformatics”.
Such papers are quite abundant and have a number of things in common.
For example, they can focus on specific suggestions, often referred to as rules or “tips & tricks”, or they can more broadly direct towards good practices of coding, which are put together into “guidelines”.

Papers often choose a main focus or a theme and then distinguish a set of rules or guidelines.
That focus can be very specialized, such as particular data analysis in a single disease [@doi:10.1186/s13024-022-00517-z].
Or the theme can be more general, for example setting the rules for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis or outlining tips on how to start on computational analysis of the experimental data [@doi:10.1016/j.jtho.2022.11.006;@doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.2996;@doi:10.1016/j.jmoldx.2017.11.003].
Both types of papers emphasize the need to learn how to analyse data properly and provide good suggestions to do that, based on the chosen topic.
However, one needs to be aware when reading specialized focus guidelines that some of them can be much less applicable if the context of the analysis is different.
Finally, the reference point matters.
There is a difference, if the guidelines are read by a person with less experience in computational data analysis, where even a small set of rules can mean a steep learning curve, because some skills that are dependencies for the rules might be common knowledge for those with more experience.
For example, a guideline to use version control systems, such as git, is a very important one, but for that a reader should most likely know the basics of the unix command line, which is not necessarily a rule on itself.
One of the first things that should be done while suggesting your set of guidelines is clearly defining your target audience, even if they are meant to be broader suggestions.

As most guidelines tend to be written for researchers or students with minimal coding experience, suggestions often overlap.
Most commonly highlighted are documentation and version control [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbw134;@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
These are basic aspects of the software quality, which are still often overlooked in the publications making it hard to reproduce the research or use a published software [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
Even the people with the least experience in computational analyses should always document their code by writing extensive README documentation.
Documentation practice is very strong in the wet lab, where having a lab journal is unquestionable.
This should not be different when working with computational tools. Version control of the code improves research reproducibility and the usage of the software.
The most popular way to do that is by using git and remote repositories, for example, GitHub or Bitbucket [@doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.2996v1;@doi:10.1186/s13024-022-00517-z;@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
Less commonly emphasized are testing of the developed code or software and optimization of pipelines [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
These are very important rules to follow to end up with a proper collection of code or a stable software [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.839].
However, it might be considered to be too advanced for "beginners" guidelines.
Unfortunately, not being aware of such requirements can lead to a code that either takes a long time to run or is buggy, which accumulates the technical debt and, in a way, encourages the bad practices.
To avoid that it is important to at least be aware of the caveats of your code and document them for fellow researchers that might use your code in the future.


As code testing and organization can be overwhelming for a less experienced computational scientist, there are multiple available tools to help organize the coding tasks and the code itself.
For example, using task management through Jira or GitHub issues, which are commonly used in team projects, where multiple people work on the same code.
However, these resources are not emphasized in the guideline's literature as this literature is most commonly focused on the individual persons and their personal practices.
Often "other people" are only mentioned when guidelines suggest where to seek help when encountering a problem with the code.
This includes consulting with colleagues, finding a mentor or participating in online communities (for example, Stack Overflow or Biostars) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008645].
More recently, new tools are introduced that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) as a helper in coding.
Tools such as GitHub copilot or editor extensions with access to ChatGPT allow to ask the models to write a piece of code to address a problem.
To our knowledge bioinformatics literature almost never presents suggestions how to code in a team setting and utilize multiple people's expertise on software development.
In contrary to software engineering-oriented literature, where there is a lot of focus on coding in a team practices [@https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development;@doi:10.1007/s10664-012-9205-0].
Hagan et al. described Code Clubs - the practice in their research lab, where group members are collectively engaged in software development through code reviews and pair coding and software engineering education through workshops or seminars [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119].
The authors give tips on how to organize such meetings and what should be the ground rules.
Sharing your coding experience with others helps minimize the isolation, allows individuals to learn from their peers, and finally helps to write a better quality software.
