## Conclusions and future perspectives ##
(<span style="background-color: yellow">From Ieva: I would call this conclusions and future perspectives and would keep the section sharp and short. From Kata: future perspective is currently missing.</span>)

Software engineering emerged and has been developing to address issues naturally arising from poorly planned software development, such as project failures, delays, incorrect functionality or defects [@doi:10.1145/3084225], none of which is unknown to the scientific community.
Indeed, the crisis of scientific software in general is widely discussed [@doi:10.1038/d41586-023-00053-w; @doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2].
It is only natural that the bioinformatics community learns from those more experienced, solving problems that have been identified.
In this case, it is both the software engineering research community and the industry experts on software and team management.

In our computational biology groups, we introduced regular seminars to learn about software solutions, and code reviews that fits our specific needs and context.
Through these meetings, we learnt about and adopted various concepts that achieve a better quality software, with special focus on reliability, performance and extensibility.
Furthermore, we have established coding standards within our groups, which ease within-group support and collaborative projects.
We note that the usage of these tools is not necessarily aligned with industry practices, due to the experimental nature of scientific software.
Nevertheless, as bioinformatics becomes a more and more software-heavy field, we believe a good direction is to collectively lower the barrier to adapting to new technologies.

A recurring question is whether a script needs refactoring or can remain a prototype.
Taschuk and Wilson [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412] suggest a cut-off where a script is being reused, shared with others or used to produce findings in a publication.
This definition would potentially include the majority of code written by bioinformaticians, but the time spent on improving the scripts should be weighed against the time required to deal with suboptimal code.
Overall, as good practices become routine, the required time investment will be reduced and the benefits will become more apparent.

When discussing our approach, it is implied that team dynamic is important, especially for such bottom-up approaches.
Huckman et al. found that the overall performance increases when team members are familiar with each other and build problem-solving routines together through cumulative experience [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Miriam Posner also points out that team management practices do not protect from a toxic environment [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
We therefore recommend to group leaders motivated in establishing coding standards within their groups to prioritize building a well functioning team.
