## Conclusions and future perspectives ##
(<span style="background-color: yellow">From Ieva: I would call this conclusions and future perspectives and would keep the section sharp and short.</span>)

Software engineering emerged and has been developing to address issues naturally arising from poorly planned software development, such as project failures, delays, incorrect functionality or defects [@doi:10.1145/3084225], none of which is unknown to the scientific community.
Indeed, the crisis of scientific software in general is widely discussed [@doi:10.1038/d41586-023-00053-w; @doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2].
It is only natural that the bioinformatics community learns from those more experienced, solving problems that have been identified.
In this case, it is both the software engineering research community and the industry experts on software and team management.

In our computational biology groups, we introduced regular seminars to learn about software solutions, and code reviews that fits our specific needs and context.
Through these meetings, we learnt about and adopted various concepts that achieve a better quality software, with special focus on reliability, performance and extensibility.
Furthermore, we have established coding standards within our groups, which ease within-group support and collaborative projects.
We note that the usage of these tools is not necessarily aligned with industry practices, due to the experimental nature of scientific software.
Nevertheless, as bioinformatics becomes a more and more software-heavy field, we believe a good direction is to collectively lower the barrier to adapting to new technologies.

When discussing our approach, it is implied that team dynamic is important, especially for such bottom-up approaches.
Huckman et al. found that the overall performance increases when team members are familiar with each other and build problem-solving routines together through cumulative experience [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
When there is a group of developers already, knowledge on who knows what (see: transactive memory system) speeds up problem solving [@doi:10.1177/1046496420967764].
Time and social factors ease technical knowledge transfer [@{http://www.jstor.org/stable/40539129}].
Miriam Posner also points out that team management practices do not protect from a toxic environment [@{https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/}].
We therefore recommend to group leaders motivated in establishing coding standards within their groups to prioritize building a well functioning team.

We envision a future where scientific software for core applications is appreciated, reliable, and actively maintained.
We believe all scientists would benefit from a strong backbone of software solutions, that would support quick and efficient prototyping, as well as maturation of working solutions.
There are necessary steps to achieve this vision [@doi:10.1109/mic.2014.88; @doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01901-x; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.1172970; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.8; @doi:10.1109/CSEET.2009.44].
We discuss these below.

The lack of funding for the maintenance of software, particularly scientific software, prevents achieving a level of software quality that would inspire confidence in the results [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.88].
Funding is typically provided for the development of novel software, and it can be hard to justify spending time on maintenance which provides no output in terms of articles.
Currently, as Alexander Szalay puts it "The funding stops when they (researchers) actually develop the software prototype" [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01901-x].
This is a problem, because future researchers would want to build on each other's findings, use previous software as tools, and spend less time adopting or maintaining software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412; @doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110848; @doi:10.1109/MIC.2014.8].
We believe the infrastructure would benefit from funding earmarked for maintenance, and from dedicating time to it in project proposals.
Fortunately in recent years, the lack of funding is being recognized and addressed by a few agencies, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science fund [@{https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/}].
Scientific community and funding agencies should welcome the efforts of maintaining original software and encourage its updates instead of the development of a replacement software that risks remaining unmaintained.

Working in teams is not an option, but a must for large projects which support thousands of reserachers world-wide, and contribute to novel findings.
There is an increasing amount of such projects for next generation sequencing, single-cell analysis, and correlation studies, to name a few.
Although it is not necessary in smaller projects, the benefits are significant.
These benefits include the following.
First and foremost, all software project start as small prototype-like software.
The fate of these can be varied.
Either they are abandoned by the original developer.
They could also technically survive the original developer, depositied on platforms like GitHub, but they might be overly cryptic and poorly documented so that no other scientist can take over [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-01901-x].
Over time a small project might be taken over by another person, thus accidentally becoming a sort of team project with (by definition) insufficient communication.
Lack of standards and good practices undermine maturation, addition of new features, and general maintainability, thus may prevent a smart solution to be used and reused over time.

Agile development can be a way forward, as the most fitting team management format for academic usage.
- Comparison to current academic coding
    - agile would be more stringent
    - agile would challenge the one project : one developer configuration
    - agile would highlight the impossibility to capitalise dividends of long-term building of knowlegebase and team chemistry
    - agile would point at the training gap

- Approaches and circumstances promoting the benefits of agile

- Cost-Benefit of adoption
